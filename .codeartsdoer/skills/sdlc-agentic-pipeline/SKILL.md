# SDLC Agentic Pipeline

A multi-agent SDLC orchestration skill that drives an entire software delivery
lifecycle — from requirements to deployment — using **Huawei Cloud CodeArts Agent**.
Six agents collaborate asynchronously through Jira comments as a message bus,
enforcing quality gates, error throwback, and human-in-the-loop checkpoints.

### PR Operation Routing

The DevOps Agent does NOT create or merge PRs. PR operations are routed to
developer agents based on which developer(s) are active:

| Scenario | PR Operations Owner | PR Ops |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| Only Frontend Agent active | Frontend Agent | `create_pull_request`, `merge_pull_request` |
| Only Backend Agent active | Backend Agent | `create_pull_request`, `merge_pull_request` |
| Both Frontend + Backend active | Backend Agent (primary) | `create_pull_request`, `merge_pull_request` |

This applies to ALL PR operations across the pipeline:
- Step 5 (merged): Auto-merge feature PRs into `dev` after E2E sign-off
- Step 8: Creating and merging `dev` -> `main` release PR
- Step 9: Pushing report to GitHub (direct push)
- Option A Step 3: Creating PRs for DevOps infrastructure changes

## Trigger

Activate this skill when the user asks to start an agentic flow, SDLC pipeline,
agentic DevOps pipeline, multi-agent development workflow, or any prompt related
to initiating the end-to-end agentic software delivery lifecycle.

## Prerequisites

Before the pipeline can run, **Step 0 (Service Onboarding)** must be completed.
Step 0 auto-provisions the 7 agent definition files (from `references/agents/`
to `.codeartsdoer/agents/`), runs the **multi-tool selection** (Step 0.0.5), and
then walks the user through setting up only the **selected** services and
generating config files. Methodology tools (SDD/TDD/DDD) are set up in
**Step 0.8**.
See `references/setup/service-onboarding.md` for the full onboarding guide.

### Step 0.0.5 - Multi-Tool Selection

After auto-provisioning agent files, the PM Agent presents a multiselect screen
where the user picks any combination of MCP servers, services, and methodology
skills. Methodology skills are grouped by methodology (SDD, TDD, DDD) - the
user selects methodologies and tools within each. The selection is persisted to
`.codeartsdoer/tool-selections.json` and drives all downstream behavior:
- **Conditional onboarding:** Only selected tools (0.1-0.8) are configured.
- **Conditional config generation:** Config files include only selected entries.
- **Conditional pipeline execution:** Steps that depend on unselected tools are
  skipped, not errored.
- **Dynamic agent permissions:** Methodology skill permissions are granted/revoked
  in agent frontmatter via the `apply-tool-selections` script.
- **Design-architecture phase:** If any methodology tools are selected, the
  design-architecture agent (Step 0.DA) runs before the main pipeline to
  classify tasks, execute methodologies (DDD -> SDD -> TDD), and hand off
  curated context. See `references/agents/design-architecture-agent.md`.

See `references/setup/multi-tool-selection-plan.md` for the full plan.

The 7 agent files bundled in the skill at `references/agents/`:
- `pm-agent.md`, `backend-agent.md`, `frontend-agent.md`,
  `code-reviewer-agent.md`, `tester-agent.md`, `devops-agent.md`,
  `design-architecture-agent.md`
- Auto-copied to `.codeartsdoer/agents/` during Step 0.0 (before any service onboarding)
- Idempotent: re-running overwrites with the latest version from the skill bundle

Step 0 involves multi-agent delegation for project bootstrap (Option B only):
- **PM Agent** orchestrates: parses prompt, splits scope, generates service configs (NO repo creation, NO git operations)
- **Backend Agent** creates repo, clones repo, builds backend code, creates `dev` branch, returns CI/CD build info
- **Frontend Agent** builds frontend code, returns CI/CD build info
- **DevOps Agent** (runs last): writes `docker-compose.yml`, shared docs (README, .gitignore), generates `ci-cd.yml` from
  template with build section filled from Backend/Frontend build info, commits shared docs
- All agents push to `dev` branch (not `main`)

Step 0 with an **existing repository (Option A)** is fundamentally different:
- **PM Agent** is READ-ONLY with the repo: inventories existing artifacts, asks user
  about development intent and branch strategy. PM Agent NEVER clones, commits, or pushes.
- **No code building** - backend/frontend code already exists in the repo
- **No branch creation** - branches are only created by developer agents when the user approves
- **Existing artifacts are sacred** - Dockerfiles, docker-compose.yml, ci-cd.yml are NEVER
  modified without explicit user approval
- **No DevOps Agent invocation** during onboarding - if the user needs CI/CD or Docker changes,
  the DevOps Agent handles this during Step 3 via a feature branch (git operations only).
  The developer agent creates and merges the PR on DevOps's behalf.
- All git write operations are delegated to developer agents (Backend, Frontend).
  The DevOps Agent owns git write for infrastructure files only but does NOT create
  or merge PRs - all PR operations are routed to developer agents.

The `playwright-cli` skill (used by the Tester Agent in Step 5) is **auto-provisioned**
during Step 0 onboarding - no manual installation is required.

> **WARNING:**
> **Critical setup conflict:** Before any CI/CD pipeline runs, the user MUST
> disable **SonarCloud Automatic Analysis** (Project Dashboard > Administration >
> Analysis Method > OFF). If both Automatic Analysis and the GitHub Actions
> SonarCloud scan are enabled, the CI/CD workflow crashes with:
> `"You are running CI analysis while Automatic Analysis is enabled"`.
> Surface this warning proactively to the user before collecting SonarCloud
> credentials.

## Agent Interaction & Permissions

### Contextual Execution

The agent must work on **project level** to apply the SDLC skill appropriately.
All 6 agent definitions set `scope: project` in their frontmatter, ensuring each
agent operates within the project context where the skill is installed rather
than at user or system scope.

### Built-in Skills & Permissions

Leverage existing built-in skills (e.g., `code-reviewer`). The agent must be
granted access to the required built-in skill Markdown files, while optional
skills should be added dynamically.

Each agent's frontmatter declares which built-in skills it may invoke under the
`permission.skill` block. Required skills are explicitly listed; optional skills
are added dynamically at runtime as needed during pipeline execution.

> **Built-in vs Selectable (Multi-Tool Selection):**
> - **Built-in utility skills** (`ide-tool`, `doc-expert`, `pptx`,
>   `data-analysis`, `prd`, `frontend-design`, `i18n-integration`) are **always
>   on** and present in every agent's frontmatter. They are never modified by
>   tool selection.
> - **Methodology skills** are grouped by methodology (SDD, TDD, DDD) and are
>   **dynamically granted/revoked** at onboarding time by the
>   `apply-tool-selections` script
>   (see `references/templates/apply-tool-selections.ps1` / `.sh`) based on
>   `.codeartsdoer/tool-selections.json` and `references/skill-registry.json`.
>   SDD tools: `creating-sdd-directory`, `managing-spec/design/tasks-document`,
>   `openspec`. TDD tools: `playwright-cli`, `postman`, `newman`,
>   `jest`, `pytest`, `junit`, `vitest`. DDD tools: `context-mapper`,
>   `eventstorming`, `structurizr`. If a methodology skill was not selected, its
>   permission keys are absent from the agent's frontmatter. The
>   design-architecture agent receives SDD, TDD, and DDD tool permissions based
>   on the user's selections.

### Permission Setup (Deterministic Configuration)

All agents use a **deny-by-default** permission model. Only explicitly allowed
skills can be invoked. The minimum required permission for every agent:

```yaml
permission:
  skill:
    '*': deny
    ide-tool: allow
```

Additional skills are granted per-agent based on their role:

| Agent | Additional Allowed Skills (beyond `ide-tool`) |
|-------|----------------------------------------------|
| PM | `creating-sdd-directory`, `data-analysis`, `doc-expert`, `managing-design-document`, `managing-spec-document`, `managing-tasks-document`, `pptx`, `prd` |
| Backend | `creating-sdd-directory`, `managing-spec-document`, `managing-design-document`, `managing-tasks-document` |
| Frontend | `creating-sdd-directory`, `frontend-design`, `i18n-integration`, `managing-spec-document`, `managing-design-document`, `managing-tasks-document` |
| Code Reviewer | _(none)_ |
| Tester | `playwright-cli` |
| DevOps | _(none)_ |
| Design-Architecture | `creating-sdd-directory`, `managing-spec-document`, `managing-design-document`, `managing-tasks-document` (SDD, if selected) + TDD/DDD tool permissions (dynamically granted via `apply-tool-selections` based on `tool-selections.json`) |

## MCP Servers Required

> **Conditional:** MCP servers are configured **only for selected tools** (see
> Step 0.0.5). If a tool is not selected, its MCP entry is omitted from
> `mcp_settings.json`. If no MCP servers are selected, the pipeline runs in
> local-only mode.

The pipeline depends on the following MCP servers configured in
`.codeartsdoer/mcp/mcp_settings.json` (only for selected tools):

| MCP Server | Purpose | Auth |
|------------|---------|------|
| `atlassian-rovo-mcp` | Jira tasks, sprints, comments, transitions | Basic (Base64 `email:token`) |
| `github` | Repos, branches, PRs, reviews, workflow dispatch | Bearer PAT |
| `sonarqube` | Quality gate, issues, coverage, hotspots | Bearer token |
| `semgrep` | Local static analysis, security scanning | App token env |
| `jfrog` | Artifactory build/artifact verification | Bearer access token |

See `references/templates/mcp-settings.json` for the template.

## The Pipeline (9 Steps + Design Phase)

> **Conditional steps:** Each step checks `.codeartsdoer/tool-selections.json`
> and degrades gracefully. Steps that depend on unselected tools are skipped,
> not errored. See `references/pipeline.md` for per-step conditional behavior.

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  STEP  AGENT(S)            ACTION                                         |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   0    PM + Frontend/Backend/DevOps  Onboarding: auto-provision agents, Opt A (existing repo, PM read-only) or Opt B (new repo, parallel Backend+Frontend build, DevOps configs) |
| 0.DA  Design-Architecture  Design phase: classify task, research, DDD/SDD/TDD methodology execution, curated handoff (conditional: runs only if methodology tools selected) |
|   1    PM                  Requirement breakdown, PRD, batch Jira task creation (hyperlinks to user) - uses curated context from 0.DA if available |
|  1b    Frontend/Backend    Requirement review (PARALLEL via Jira async dispatch) |
|   2    PM + Developer         Sprint start (Jira Agile API) + SDD setup (developer agent: docs branch + PR to dev) |
|   3    Frontend/Backend    Code dev (PARALLEL via Jira async), Semgrep pre-scan, branching, PR, tests |
|   4    Code Reviewer       PR review (batch), secret scanning (batch), GitHub approval |
|   5    Tester + PM + Dev   E2E testing + auto-merge feature PRs (5b merged into 5) + CI/CD auto-triggers |
|   6    DevOps              CI/CD (auto-triggered, cached) + JFrog verify + SonarCloud QG (combined) |
|   7    PM+Developer        Release review (PM: sign-offs+approval) + merge (Developer: PR create+merge, simplified conflict resolution) |
|   8    PM+DevOps            Deploy auth (PM: human approval) + execution (DevOps: SSH+docker pull+run) |
|   9    PM+Developer        Sprint close, retro, HTML report, docs branch + PR to GitHub |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Key Performance Optimizations

1. **Parallel dispatch via Jira async**: Backend + Frontend agents work simultaneously
   (Steps 0, 1b, 3). PM dispatches via Jira comments, both agents pick up independently.
2. **Batch Jira operations**: Bulk create API for tasks (Step 1), batch transitions.
3. **PR-based flow for docs/reports**: `.opencode/**`, `docs/**`, `reports/**` paths
   use a docs branch + PR targeting `dev` (GitHub branch protection applies to the whole
   branch, not individual paths, so a PR is required even for documentation changes).
4. **Auto-trigger CI/CD**: `on: push` to `dev` branch. No manual DevOps trigger (Step 5->6).
5. **Cached builds**: pip, node_modules, Docker layers cached in GitHub Actions (Step 6).
6. **Combined CI/CD + verification**: JFrog artifact check + SonarCloud QG
   are CI/CD pipeline stages, not separate DevOps API calls (Step 6).
7. **Simplified conflict resolution**: Default "prefer dev" strategy (4 steps, not 18).
   Full domain-owner resolution only if CI/CD fails on resolution branch (Step 7).
8. **Node.js 22 LTS**: Upgraded from Node.js 18 to 22 across all pipeline jobs.
9. **FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24**: Suppresses Node.js 20 deprecation warnings.
10. **sonarcloud-github-action@master**: Uses old SonarSource action (sonarqube-scan-action has Docker/Node.js compat issue).

+-------------------------+
```

## Step 9: Report Generation Details

At the end of the SDLC flow (Step 9), the PM Agent generates an HTML report
summarizing the entire process, operations, and actions taken during the flow.

### HTML Report (`reports/sdlc-report.html`)

- Self-contained vanilla HTML/CSS (no frameworks) - inline CSS, no external dependencies
- Save in the repository directory
- All hyperlinks must open in the user's **external system browser** (use `target="_blank"`)
- All hyperlinks must be **real working URLs** (not `#` placeholders) constructed from `.env` values:
  - Jira: `https://{JIRA_CLOUD_ID}/browse/{ISSUE-KEY}`
  - GitHub: `https://github.com/{GITHUB_OWNER}/{GITHUB_REPO}`
  - PRs: `https://github.com/{GITHUB_OWNER}/{GITHUB_REPO}/pull/{PR_NUMBER}`
  - SonarCloud: `https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id={SONAR_PROJECT_KEY}`
   - JFrog: `{JFROG_PLATFORM_URL}/ui/repos/tree/General/{JFROG_REPO_KEY}`
  - GitHub Actions: `https://github.com/{GITHUB_OWNER}/{GITHUB_REPO}/actions`
- Contents (single-page scrollable report):
  - Header: project name (linked to GitHub repo), sprint name, date range, overall status badge
  - Summary table: step | status | agent | key outcome
  - Step-by-step detail cards with expand/collapse sections:
    - Step 0: Service links (GitHub repo, Jira board, SonarCloud dashboard, JFrog repo) - all clickable
    - Step 1: Jira tasks table with clickable hyperlinks to each Jira issue (key, summary, label, status)
    - Step 3: Development table with branch names, PR links (clickable), merge status per Jira task
    - Step 5: E2E test results table with test scenarios, PASS/FAIL badges, durations, total count
    - Step 6: CI/CD pipeline stages with GitHub Actions link, stage-by-stage pass/fail status
    - Step 6: JFrog Docker image table (image name, tags, size, verified badge) + SonarCloud QG metric cards:
      - Coverage % (actual number, not ">80%")
      - Duplication % (actual number, not "<3%")
      - Security rating (A/B/C/D/E)
      - Reliability rating (A/B/C/D/E)
      - Maintainability rating (A/B/C/D/E)
      - Bugs count
      - Vulnerabilities count
      - Code smells count
    - Step 8: Deployment details (Docker pull, container start, health check HTTP code, deployment URL)
    - Sprint velocity chart (CSS-based bar chart)
  - Retrospective section: what went well, what didn't, action items

### Push Report to GitHub

- Delegate to developer agent (Backend if both active, otherwise sole developer) to create a `docs/sdlc-reports` branch from `dev`
- Commit `reports/sdlc-report.html`
- DIRECT PUSH to `dev` (no PR needed - `reports/**` exempt via path-based branch protection)
- Report PR link (if created) or commit URL to user

### Present Report to User

- Show file path to `reports/sdlc-report.html`
- Show GitHub PR link where report was pushed


## Agent Reference

Each agent has a dedicated role definition bundled in `references/agents/` and
auto-copied to `.codeartsdoer/agents/` during Step 0.0. The PM Agent
is the orchestrator (`mode: all`); all others run as subagents (`mode: subagent`).

| Agent | File | Steps | Key Responsibility |
|-------|------|-------|--------------------|
| PM | `pm-agent.md` | 0, 1, 1b, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9 | Orchestration, PRD, batch Jira ops, sprint mgmt, release authorization, sprint retro |
| Backend | `backend-agent.md` | 0, 1b, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9 | Server code, APIs, DB, API tests, repo creation, build info, PR operations (primary when both active), parallel dispatch |
| Frontend | `frontend-agent.md` | 0, 1b, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9 | UI code, components, unit tests, build info, PR operations (when sole developer), parallel dispatch |
| Code Reviewer | `code-reviewer-agent.md` | 4 | Batch PR review, batch secret scanning, approval sign-off |
| Tester | `tester-agent.md` | 5 | Playwright E2E, bug reporting, coverage |
| DevOps | `devops-agent.md` | 0, 6, 8 | docker-compose, ci-cd.yml (auto-trigger + cache + combined), CI/CD monitoring, deployment (NO PR operations) |
| Design-Architecture | `design-architecture-agent.md` | 0.DA | Task classification, research, DDD/SDD/TDD methodology execution, curated handoff (no code writing, no commits) |

## Jira Status Lifecycle

```
  To Do ---> In Progress ---> In Review ---> In Testing ---> Done
  (created)   (dev starts)    (PR ready)     (E2E testing)  (PM release)

  Error throwback transitions:
  +-------------------+-------------------+-----------------------------------+
  | From              | To                | Reason                            |
  +-------------------+-------------------+-----------------------------------+
  | In Review         | In Progress       | Code review found issues          |
  | In Testing        | In Progress       | E2E test found bugs               |
  | In Testing        | In Review         | Test environment issue (not code) |
  | Release Review    | In Progress       | Release gate failed               |
  | In Testing        | In Progress       | SonarCloud QG failed (coverage, security)  |
  +-------------------+-------------------+-----------------------------------+
```

## Agent Routing Labels

Jira labels (NOT assignee) route tasks to the correct agent:

| Label | Routes To |
|-------|-----------|
| `agent:frontend` | Frontend Agent |
| `agent:backend` | Backend Agent |
| `agent:code-reviewer` | Code Reviewer Agent |
| `agent:devops` | DevOps Agent |
| `agent:tester` | Tester Agent |
| `agent:pm` | PM Agent |

**Domain labels:** `frontend` `backend` `bug` `test` `security` `devops`
`release` `documentation` `feature` `refactor`

## Inter-Agent Messaging

All inter-agent communication happens via **Jira comments** using this format:

```
@agent:<target-agent> <message>
```

Examples:
- `@agent:backend Please review requirements - confirm feasibility, flag gaps`
- `@agent:code-reviewer PR #42 ready for review - backend implementation complete`
- `@agent:devops E2E sign-off complete - all tests passing, ready for CI/CD`

## Task Discovery (JQL)

| Agent | JQL |
|-------|-----|
| Frontend | `labels = agent:frontend AND status = "To Do"` |
| Backend | `labels = agent:backend AND status = "To Do"` |
| Code Reviewer | `labels = agent:code-reviewer AND status = "In Review"` |
| Tester | `labels = agent:tester AND status = "In Review"` |
| DevOps | `labels = agent:devops AND status = "In Review"` |
| PM | `labels = agent:pm AND status = "To Do"` |

## Branch Strategy (GitFlow)

```
main  (production-ready - only released code, deploy from here)
 │
 └── dev  (integration branch - all PRs merge here first)
       ├── feature/<agent>/<short-description>
       ├── fix/<agent>/<short-description>
       ├── bug/<agent>/<short-description>
       └── docs/sdd-<feature_name>
```

- **`main`**: Production branch. Only updated via `dev` → `main` merge at release time (Step 7).
  Branch protection rules MUST be enabled (no direct pushes).
- **`dev`**: Integration branch. All feature, fix, and docs PRs target `dev` as base.
  Multiple feature branches merge here for integration testing before release.
- **Feature/fix/bug/docs branches**: Created from `dev`, merged back to `dev` via PR.

> **Option A (Existing Repo):** The user's existing branch strategy takes precedence.
> During onboarding (Step 0.A.6), the PM Agent asks the user which branch strategy to
> use (existing `develop`, GitFlow `dev`, trunk-based, or custom). The selected branch
> is persisted and passed to all downstream agents (Backend, Frontend, DevOps) for
> CI/CD triggers, feature merges, and release PRs. Branches are only created by
> developer agents, never by the PM Agent.

### Release Merge: `dev` → `main`

At Step 7 (Release Review), after all feature PRs are merged into `dev` and all
gates pass, the PM Agent authorizes and the developer agent (Backend if both active,
otherwise sole developer) creates and merges `dev` into `main` via GitHub MCP.
This is the only way code reaches `main`. Deployment (Step 8) always pulls from `main`.

## Branch Naming Convention

```
feature/<agent>/<short-description>   e.g. feature/backend/projects-tasks-api
fix/<agent>/<short-description>       e.g. fix/backend/sql-injection
bug/<agent>/<short-description>       e.g. bug/frontend/login-redirect
docs/sdd-<feature_name>               e.g. docs/sdd-sprint-1
```

All branches are created from `dev` and merged back to `dev` via PR.

## PR Merge Gate (Enforced by PM Agent)

### Feature PR -> `dev` (after Step 5 E2E sign-off)

A feature/fix/bug PR may only be merged into `dev` when ALL of the following are satisfied:

1. Code Reviewer Agent sign-off comment exists on Jira task
2. Tester Agent E2E sign-off comment exists on Jira task
3. Human approval (via PM Agent question tool)

> **NOTE:** CI green and SonarCloud QG are NOT required at this stage.
> CI/CD runs on `dev` AFTER the feature PR is merged (Step 6).
> SonarCloud QG is checked in Step 7. Both are gates for the
> Release Merge (`dev` -> `main`) in Step 7, not for the feature PR merge.

### SDD Docs PR → `dev`

Lightweight merge — developer agent merges immediately after user review.
No Code Reviewer/Tester/CI sign-off required (documentation only).

### Release Merge: `dev` → `main` (Step 8)

The `dev` → `main` merge may only happen when ALL of the following are satisfied:

1. All feature PRs have been merged into `dev`
2. Integration CI/CD passed on `dev` branch
3. SonarCloud Quality Gate passes on `dev`
4. All Jira tasks have Code Reviewer + Tester sign-off
5. Human approval (via PM Agent question tool)

## Error Throwback Protocol

When any downstream step reports a failure, the PM Agent routes the task back:

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  FAILURE DETECTED                                                         |

|  PM Agent receives error via Jira comment                                 |

|       v                                                                   |
|  PM Agent tracks re-work until resolved                                   |
|       |                                                                   |
|       v                                                                   |
|  Normal flow resumes from the fixed step onward                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## Human-in-the-Loop Checkpoints

The pipeline requires explicit human approval at these points:

| Checkpoint | Step | Tool |
|------------|------|------|
| Domain model approval (DDD) | 0.DA | `continue` reply |
| Spec approval (SDD) | 0.DA | `continue` reply |
| SDD document review before pushing to GitHub | 2 | `question` tool |
| Release approval before deployment | 7 | `question` tool |
| Deployment authorization to Huawei ECS | 8 | `question` tool |

> **If user rejects any checkpoint:** The pipeline pauses. PM Agent asks the user
> for feedback via `question` tool and routes tasks back to the appropriate step
> (Step 3 for code changes, Step 5 for PR merge, Step 7 for release, Step 8 for deployment).


## Critical Setup Warnings (Surface Proactively)

> **WARNING:**
> 1. **SonarCloud Automatic Analysis conflict**: MUST be disabled before any
>    CI/CD run. If left enabled alongside the GitHub Actions scan, the pipeline
>    crashes. Requires Project Administrator permissions.
> 2. **Jira direct REST API 401**: Direct calls to `{site}.atlassian.net` with
>    Basic auth return 401. Must use the Atlassian API gateway
>    (`api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/{cloudUuid}/rest/...`) with the `Authorization`
>    header from `.codeartsdoer/mcp/mcp_settings.json`
>    (`mcpServers["atlassian-rovo-mcp"].headers.Authorization`). Any other auth
>    token will fail. Discover the cloud UUID by calling
>    `atlassian-rovo-mcp_getVisibleJiraProjects` and extracting it from the `self`
>    URL in the response. On Windows, the CodeArts Bash tool strips `$` from
>    inline PowerShell — always write a `.ps1` script file first, then execute
>    with `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File`.
> 3. **Jira sprint name length**: Must be shorter than 30 characters or the API
>    returns 400.
> 4. **Sprint field value type**: `customfield_10020` (Sprint) must be a number,
>    NOT an array - e.g. `{ "customfield_10020": 34 }`.
> 5. **Manual integrations required**: GitHub<->Jira, GitHub<->SonarCloud, and
>    GitHub<->Semgrep links must be configured manually in each platform's UI.
> 6. **Sprint close requires full object**: `PUT /rest/agile/1.0/sprint/{id}` does
>    NOT support partial updates. Sending only `{"state": "closed"}` returns 400.
>    Must `GET /sprint/{id}` first to fetch existing `name` and `startDate`, then
>    `PUT` with complete body: `{state, name, startDate, endDate, goal}`.
> 6b. **Sprint close must use gateway URL + MCP auth**: Direct site URL
>    (`{site}.atlassian.net`) always returns 401. Must use the Atlassian API gateway
>    (`https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/{cloudUuid}/rest/agile/1.0`) with the
>    `Authorization` header from `.codeartsdoer/mcp/mcp_settings.json`
>    (`mcpServers["atlassian-rovo-mcp"].headers.Authorization`). On Windows, the
>    CodeArts Bash tool strips `$` from inline PowerShell — always write a `.ps1`
>    script file first, then execute with `powershell -File`.
> 7. **JFrog Docker repository naming**: Do NOT use underscores in repository names
>    (DNS limitation). Use hyphens (e.g., `docker-dev-local` not `docker_dev_local`).
> 8. **JFrog build API requires project param**: `GET /artifactory/api/build/{name}`
>    returns 404 without `?project={project-key}` query parameter.
> 9. **Jira 'In Testing' status required**: The pipeline uses 'In Testing' during Step 5.
>    This status does NOT exist by default. Must be manually added:
>    Settings -> Work items -> Workflows -> Edit -> Add status -> Create 'In Testing'
>    (category: In Progress) -> Enable 'Allow all statuses to transition to this one'.
> 10. **Never push directly to main**: All changes — including SDD documentation —
>    must go through a feature/docs branch and PR targeting `dev`. Enable GitHub branch
>    protection rules on both `main` and `dev` (Settings > Branches > Branch protection
>    rules) to enforce this. `main` is only updated via `dev` → `main` merge at release
>    time (Step 7). SDD docs use a docs branch + PR targeting `dev` (GitHub branch protection
>    applies to the whole branch, so a PR is required); code changes require the full PR Merge Gate (5 sign-offs).

## Config Templates

Ready-to-fill templates are in `references/templates/`:

| Template | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `mcp-settings.json` | MCP server configuration (conditional: only selected MCP entries included) |
| `ci-cd.yml` | GitHub Actions workflow template (conditional: only selected stages included; not generated if GitHub not selected) |
| `sonar-project.properties` | SonarCloud project configuration (only if SonarCloud selected) |
| `env-template.env` | Environment variables (conditional: only selected service blocks included) |
| `set-secrets.js` | GitHub Actions secrets/variables setup script (conditional: only selected service secrets/vars) |
| `add_ssh_key.py` | Python script to add SSH public key to Huawei Cloud ECS for key-based authentication |
| `apply-tool-selections.ps1` | Windows: updates agent `permission.skill` blocks based on `tool-selections.json` + `skill-registry.json` (methodology skills only, never touches built-in) |
| `apply-tool-selections.sh` | macOS/Linux: same as above |

### Runtime Config Files (generated during onboarding, not templates)

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `.codeartsdoer/tool-selections.json` | User's tool selections (written in Step 0.0.5, read by all agents). Local only - add to `.gitignore`. |
| `references/skill-registry.json` | Methodology skill registry (v2) - single source of truth for selectable skills, grouped by methodology (SDD/TDD/DDD). Drives selection UI, config generation, agent permission logic, and methodology tool setup (Step 0.8). |

## Execution Notes

> **Re-running the pipeline:** If the pipeline is re-run for the same sprint,
> the PM Agent checks existing state (sprint, tasks, PRs, CI runs, artifacts,
> deployment) and skips already-completed steps. See `references/pipeline.md`
> Step Details section for full idempotency checklist.

- The PM Agent is the only agent that can authorize deployment and close sprints.
- **PM Agent is READ-ONLY with the repository** (minimal GitHub MCP access: `get_file_contents`,
  `get_commit`, `list_commits` only). All other GitHub operations (`list_branches`,
  `search_code`, `pull_request_read`, `create_pull_request`, `merge_pull_request`)
  are delegated to **developer agents** (Backend or Frontend). The PM Agent NEVER runs
  `git clone`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git checkout`, or `github_create_repository`.
- **DevOps Agent does NOT create or merge PRs.** The DevOps Agent owns git write operations
  for infrastructure files only (clone, branch, commit, push). PR operations
  (`create_pull_request`, `merge_pull_request`) are routed to developer agents:
  Backend Agent (if both active or only backend), Frontend Agent (if only frontend).
  The DevOps Agent retains read-only GitHub access (`list_branches`, `search_code`,
  `pull_request_read`) for CI/CD monitoring.
- **Existing artifacts are sacred (Option A).** If the repo already contains
  Dockerfiles, `docker-compose.yml`, `ci-cd.yml`, or `sonar-project.properties`,
  the pipeline MUST NOT modify or overwrite them without explicit user approval.
- **Branches are user-controlled (Option A).** The pipeline MUST NOT create, delete,
  or rename branches unless the user explicitly approves. The user's existing branch
  strategy is respected.
- During Step 0 onboarding with Option B (new repo), the PM Agent delegates code
  building to Backend, Frontend, and DevOps agents via the Task tool. The Backend Agent
  creates the repo via `github_create_repository`, clones it, and creates `dev` from `main`;
  all agents push to `dev` branch. DevOps Agent runs last to see both Dockerfiles before
  writing `docker-compose.yml`, `ci-cd.yml`, and shared docs (README, .gitignore).
  The PM Agent does NOT create the repo or clone it.
- During Step 0 onboarding with Option A (existing repo), the PM Agent performs
  read-only inventory and asks the user about their intent and branch strategy.
  No code is built, no branches are created, no files are pushed by the PM Agent.
- Backend and Frontend agents return CI/CD build info (setup action, install/build/test
  commands) to the PM Agent, who passes it to the DevOps Agent for `ci-cd.yml` configuration.
- Tester Agent exclusively owns E2E/Playwright tests; Frontend/Backend own unit
  and component tests. Do NOT cross this boundary.
- SonarCloud MCP only reads remote analysis results - it cannot perform local
  analysis. Use Semgrep MCP for local scanning.
- CI/CD is **auto-triggered** on push to `dev` (not manual). This ensures
  only reviewed, tested code enters the pipeline immediately after merge.
- All SDD documents (`spec.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`) are pushed to GitHub
  via a developer agent on a docs branch + PR targeting `dev` (GitHub branch protection
  applies to the whole branch, so a PR is required).
- **Step 5 (E2E + Auto-Merge):** Tester runs E2E, then PM verifies gates +
  asks human approval, developer agent merges feature PRs into `dev`. CI/CD
  auto-triggers on dev push (no separate Step 5b or manual CI/CD trigger).
- **Step 6 (CI/CD + Verification Combined):** CI/CD auto-triggered on dev push.
  Pipeline includes: SonarCloud scan, cached build, Docker push to JFrog, JFrog
  artifact verification, SonarCloud QG check. DevOps
  reads final pipeline status (1 API call instead of 8+ separate verification calls).
- **Step 7 (Release Merge):** PM Agent authorizes (sign-offs + human approval),
   developer agent (Backend if both active, otherwise sole developer) creates and merges
   the `dev` -> `main` PR via GitHub MCP. Conflict resolution uses domain-owner strategy
   (each agent resolves its own files; do NOT blanket-accept dev for all files).
- **Step 8 (Deployment):** PM Agent authorizes (human approval), DevOps Agent
  executes (SSH into Huawei Cloud ECS, docker pull, docker run, health check,
  rollback on failure).
- **Step 9 (Report Push):** PM Agent generates HTML report, developer agent
  (Backend if both active, otherwise sole developer) creates a docs branch + PR
  targeting `dev` and merges it (GitHub branch protection applies to the whole branch).

## Sharing This Skill

To share this skill with others:

1. Copy the entire `sdlc-agentic-pipeline/` directory into the recipient's
   project `.codeartsdoer/skills/` directory.
2. Append `sdlc-agentic-pipeline=true` to their
   `.codeartsdoer/skills/ProjectSkillStatus.txt`.
3. The recipient should then run Step 0 (Service Onboarding) to configure their
   own service credentials before starting a pipeline run.

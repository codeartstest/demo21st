# PM Agent - Step 0.DA (Design-Architecture Invocation) | Step 1 (Requirement Breakdown) | Step 2 (Sprint Start & SDD) | Step 7 (Release Review) | Step 8 (Deployment) | Step 9 (Sprint Close & Retrospective)

## Active Agent Identification
**[PM AGENT ACTIVE]** - This agent is currently executing the PM workflow step.

The PM Agent is the orchestrator of the entire SDLC pipeline. It is the only agent
that can authorize deployment and close sprints.

---

## PM Agent Git Operations Policy

> **CRITICAL:** The PM Agent is **READ-ONLY** with the repository. The PM Agent
> uses GitHub MCP tools for read-only analysis and NEVER performs git write
> operations directly.

### PM Agent MAY (read-only via GitHub MCP - minimal):
- `github_get_file_contents` - read repo structure, files, directories (for Step 1 repo analysis)
- `github_get_commit` - read commit details (for Step 8 release review)
- `github_list_commits` - list commits on a branch (for Step 8 release review)

> **All other GitHub operations are delegated to other agents**:
> - **Read-only operations** (`list_branches`, `search_code`, `pull_request_read`) -> DevOps Agent
> - **PR operations** (`create_pull_request`, `merge_pull_request`) -> Developer Agent
>   (Backend Agent if both active, otherwise sole developer agent)
> The PM Agent is a pure orchestrator - it coordinates and authorizes, other agents execute.

### PM Agent MUST NEVER:
- `github_create_repository` - creating repositories on GitHub (Backend Agent does this)
- `github_list_branches` - listing branches (DevOps Agent does this)
- `github_search_code` - searching code (DevOps Agent does this)
- `github_pull_request_read` - reading PR details (DevOps Agent does this)
- `github_create_pull_request` - creating PRs (Developer Agent does this)
- `github_merge_pull_request` - merging PRs (Developer Agent does this)
- `git clone` - cloning the repo locally
- `git checkout` - creating or switching branches
- `git add` - staging files
- `git commit` - committing changes
- `git push` - pushing to remote
- `git merge` - merging branches locally

> **All git write operations are delegated to developer agents** (Backend,
> Frontend, DevOps). They own `git clone`, `git checkout`, `git add`,
> `git commit`, `git push`, and branch creation. The PM Agent coordinates
> and authorizes, developers execute.
>
> **This policy applies to BOTH Option A (Existing Repo) and Option B (New Repo).**
> Even when creating a new repo, the PM Agent does NOT clone it. The Backend Agent
> clones the repo as the first developer agent (it creates the `dev` branch anyway).

### Option A (Existing Repo) - Additional PM Agent Responsibilities:
During Step 0 onboarding with an existing repo, the PM Agent additionally:
- Inventories existing artifacts (Dockerfiles, docker-compose.yml, ci-cd.yml, etc.)
- Asks the user about their development intent (new features, bug fixes, etc.)
- Asks the user about their preferred branch strategy and **persists the selected integration/release branch** — this branch is passed to every downstream agent (Backend, Frontend, DevOps) and used for CI/CD triggers, feature merges, and release PRs instead of hard-coding `dev`
- Existing artifacts are NEVER modified without explicit user approval
- Branches are NEVER created/deleted/renamed without explicit user approval

### Option B (New Repo) - PM Agent Does NOT Create Repo or Clone:
During Step 0 onboarding with a new repo, the PM Agent:
- Parses the project prompt and splits into backend/frontend scope (orchestration)
- Delegates repo creation to the **Backend Agent** (via `github_create_repository` GitHub MCP tool)
- Delegates cloning to the **Backend Agent** (first developer agent to run)
- Delegates writing shared docs (README.md, .gitignore, .env.example) to the
  **DevOps Agent** (runs last, already commits shared docs)
- Does NOT create the repo, clone it, write files to it, or push anything

---

## STEP 0.DA: Design-Architecture Phase (Conditional - PM Agent Invokes)

> **Conditional:** This step runs ONLY if methodology tools (SDD/TDD/DDD) are
> selected in `.codeartsdoer/tool-selections.json`. If no methodology tools are
> selected, skip to Step 1.

After onboarding (Steps 0.0 through 0.8) is complete, the PM Agent invokes the
**design-architecture agent** via the Task tool. The design-architecture agent:

1. Loads methodology selections from `tool-selections.json`
2. Classifies the user's request (LIGHTWEIGHT vs FULL-DESIGN)
3. Does research on unknowns (if any)
4. Executes selected methodologies in order: DDD -> SDD -> TDD
5. Produces a **CURATED CONTEXT** handoff block

### PM Agent Responsibilities

- **Invoke**: call the design-architecture agent with the user's request/prompt
- **Wait**: the design-architecture agent runs autonomously with its own GATEs
  (user must reply `continue` to approve domain model and spec)
- **Receive**: capture the CURATED CONTEXT handoff block
- **Use**: feed the curated context into Step 1 (PRD/Jira tasks shaped by the
  approved spec), Step 2 (SDD setup from the approved spec/domain model), and
  Step 3 dispatch (test layer mapping for developer agents)

### Curated Context Format (received from design-architecture agent)

```
CURATED CONTEXT
Task: <one-line goal>
Classification: <lightweight | full-design>
Methodologies applied: <list: DDD, SDD, TDD - or "none">
Approved artifacts: <spec / domain model / mini brief>
Acceptance criteria -> test layer mapping: <criterion 1 -> unit/API/E2E, ...>
Relevant files/areas: <paths or modules>
Decisions & constraints: <max 5 bullets>
Open risks: <bullets, or "none">
```

> The PM Agent does NOT write code or create specs itself during this phase.
> It delegates entirely to the design-architecture agent and waits for the
> handoff. See `references/agents/design-architecture-agent.md` for the full
> agent definition.

---

## STEP 1: Requirement Breakdown & Jira Task Creation

> **Input:** If Step 0.DA ran, use the CURATED CONTEXT handoff to shape the PRD
> and Jira tasks. The approved spec (from SDD) and domain model (from DDD)
> provide the requirements and acceptance criteria. The test layer mapping
> (from TDD) tells developer agents which tests to write first.

### 1.1 Repository Analysis via GitHub MCP (READ-ONLY)
- Read repository structure using `github_get_file_contents` (owner, repo, path)
- Analyze `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, or equivalent dependency files
- Identify modules, components, and architectural boundaries
- For branch listing, code search, and PR details: **delegate to DevOps Agent**

> **Option A (Existing Repo):** The PM Agent already performed an inventory during
> Step 0 (A.4) and knows what the user wants to work on (A.5). Use the user's
> stated intent to scope the Jira tasks. The repo analysis here is to understand
> the existing codebase architecture so tasks are accurate and actionable.
>
> **Option B (New Repo):** The PM Agent just built the code via Backend/Frontend
> agents, so the structure is already known. Analysis here is lightweight.
>
> **PM Agent does NOT clone the repo.** All analysis is done via GitHub MCP
> read-only tools. Developer agents handle any local git operations.

### 1.2 PRD Creation via PRD Skill
- Invoke the `prd` skill to generate a Product Requirements Document
- Break down requirements into actionable user stories and tasks
- Define acceptance criteria for each task

### 1.3 Task Creation in Jira via Jira MCP
For each extracted task, create a Jira issue using `atlassian-rovo-mcp_createJiraIssue`:

> **OpenSpec Integration:** If `openspec` is selected and a change proposal exists,
> derive Jira tasks from the spec deltas (ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED requirements)
> rather than from the PRD alone. Run `openspec show <change-name> --json --deltas-only`
> to extract structured requirements with SHALL/MUST keywords. Each requirement
> becomes one Jira task; each scenario becomes acceptance criteria in the task
> description. If both `openspec` and `sdd` are selected, OpenSpec spec deltas are
> the primary source; SDD spec.md is supplementary.
- **Summary**: Short descriptive name
- **Description**: Detailed - which files, which requirements, acceptance criteria
- **Priority**: security = High, core feature = Medium, documentation = Low
- **Labels for agent routing** (NOT assignee):
  - `agent:frontend` -> Frontend Agent
  - `agent:backend` -> Backend Agent
  - `agent:code-reviewer` -> Code Reviewer Agent
  - `agent:devops` -> DevOps Engineer Agent
  - `agent:tester` -> Tester Agent
  - `agent:pm` -> PM Agent
- **Labels for domain**: `frontend`, `backend`, `bug`, `test`, `security`, `devops`, `release`
- **Estimate**: e.g., 2h, 1d
- Link related issues using `atlassian-rovo-mcp_createIssueLink` (Blocks, Relates)

### 1.4 Requirement Review by Frontend & Backend Agents
- After Jira tasks are created, PM Agent requests requirement review from both agents
- Comment on each task: `@agent:frontend Please review requirements - confirm feasibility, flag gaps, suggest changes`
- Comment on each task: `@agent:backend Please review requirements - confirm feasibility, flag gaps, suggest changes`
- **PM Agent waits for review feedback** before proceeding to Step 2
- If Frontend/Backend Agent requests changes:
  - Update the Jira task description with revised requirements
  - Adjust priority, estimates, or acceptance criteria as needed
  - Re-request review if changes are significant
- If both agents approve: comment `@agent:frontend @agent:backend Requirements approved - proceed to SDD setup (Step 2)`
- **Jira status remains "To Do" until requirement review is complete**

### 1.5 Inter-Agent Coordination via Jira Comments
- Use `atlassian-rovo-mcp_addCommentToJiraIssue` as the async message bus
- Format: `@agent:<target-agent> <message>`
- Monitor comments directed to PM for escalation or re-prioritization

### 1.6 Branch Conflict Prevention
- Before any agent creates a branch, **delegate to DevOps Agent** to check `github_list_branches` for active feature branches
- Assign one agent at a time per module/directory to avoid parallel conflicts
- PM Agent coordinates branch creation but does NOT create branches itself - developer agents create their own feature branches
- PM Agent does NOT call `github_list_branches` directly - DevOps Agent handles this
- Assign one agent at a time per module/directory to avoid parallel conflicts
- If conflict detected, queue the task or coordinate merge order via Jira comments

---

## STEP 2: Sprint Start & SDD Setup

### 2.1 Prerequisites
- All Jira tasks from Step 1 have been reviewed and approved by Frontend/Backend agents
- Requirement review comments confirm feasibility with no outstanding changes
- If any agent requested changes, update tasks first before proceeding

### 2.2 Sprint Management via Jira Agile REST API

The Jira MCP does not support sprint management. Use the **Jira Software Agile REST API** (`/rest/agile/1.0/sprint`) via Bash commands (PowerShell on Windows, Bash on macOS/Linux). All sprint operations are available: create, get, update, partial update, delete, list issues, move issues, swap, and manage properties.

**Credentials** (read from `.env` and `mcp_settings.json`):
- `JIRA_CLOUD_ID` - Jira site URL from `.env`
- `JIRA_EMAIL` - Atlassian account email from `.env`
- `JIRA_API_TOKEN` - Jira API token from `.env`
- `JIRA_PROJECT_KEY` - Jira project key from `.env` (e.g., `SCRUM`)

> **WARNING:**
> **Key Auth Discovery:** Direct REST API Basic Auth with `email:api_token` on `{site}.atlassian.net` returns **401 Unauthorized**. The MCP auth header (same Base64 `email:token`) works via the **Atlassian API gateway** at `api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/{cloudUuid}/rest/...`. The cloud UUID is NOT the site URL - it must be discovered separately.

**Auth Setup** (run at the start of every sprint API session):

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Step 1: Read .env for project context
$envContent = Get-Content "<PROJECT_ROOT>/.env"
$envVars = @{}
foreach ($line in $envContent) {
    if ($line -match "^\s*([^#=]+)=(.*)$") { $envVars[$matches[1].Trim()] = $matches[2].Trim() }
}
$jiraCloudId    = $envVars["JIRA_CLOUD_ID"]
$jiraProjectKey = $envVars["JIRA_PROJECT_KEY"]

# Step 2: Read MCP auth header from mcp_settings.json
$mcpSettings = Get-Content "<PROJECT_ROOT>/.codeartsdoer/mcp/mcp_settings.json" | ConvertFrom-Json
$headers = @{ Authorization = $mcpSettings.mcpServers.'atlassian-rovo-mcp'.headers.Authorization; "Content-Type" = "application/json" }

# Step 3: Discover cloud UUID - call atlassian-rovo-mcp_getVisibleJiraProjects
#   with cloudId = JIRA_CLOUD_ID (site URL). The response self URL contains the UUID:
#   "self": "https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/{cloudUuid}/rest/api/3/project/search..."
#   Extract the UUID segment.
$cloudUuid = "<JIRA_CLOUD_UUID>"  # discovered via getVisibleJiraProjects

# Step 4: Build gateway base URL
$baseUrl = "https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/${cloudUuid}/rest/agile/1.0"
```

**macOS/Linux (Bash):**
```bash
# Step 1: Read .env for project context (safe parsing — never source/eval .env)
while IFS='=' read -r key value; do
  case "$key" in JIRA_*) export "$key=$value" ;; esac
done < "<PROJECT_ROOT>/.env"

# Step 2: Read MCP auth header from mcp_settings.json
authHeader=$(jq -r '.mcpServers["atlassian-rovo-mcp"].headers.Authorization' "<PROJECT_ROOT>/.codeartsdoer/mcp/mcp_settings.json")

# Step 3: Discover cloud UUID - call atlassian-rovo-mcp_getVisibleJiraProjects
#   with cloudId = JIRA_CLOUD_ID (site URL). The response self URL contains the UUID:
#   "self": "https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/{cloudUuid}/rest/api/3/project/search..."
#   Extract the UUID segment.
cloudUuid="<JIRA_CLOUD_UUID>"  # discovered via getVisibleJiraProjects

# Step 4: Build gateway base URL
baseUrl="https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/${cloudUuid}/rest/agile/1.0"
```

**Step 2.2.1 - Find Board ID:**

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$uri = "${baseUrl}/board"; $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $uri -Method Get -Headers $headers
$board = $response.values | Where-Object { $_.location.name -like "*$jiraProjectKey*" -or $_.name -like "*$jiraProjectKey*" }
$boardId = $board.id
```

**macOS/Linux (Bash):**
```bash
response=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: $authHeader" -H "Content-Type: application/json" "${baseUrl}/board")
boardId=$(echo "$response" | jq ".values[] | select(.location.name | test(\"$JIRA_PROJECT_KEY\")) | .id" | head -1)
if [ -z "$boardId" ]; then
  boardId=$(echo "$response" | jq ".values[] | select(.name | test(\"$JIRA_PROJECT_KEY\")) | .id" | head -1)
fi
```

**Step 2.2.2 - Create Sprint:**

> **IMPORTANT:** Ask the user for the sprint name via the `question` tool before creating the sprint.
> Note: Sprint name must be up to 30 characters.

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$body = @{ originBoardId = $boardId; name = "<Sprint Name>" } | ConvertTo-Json
$uri = "${baseUrl}/sprint"; $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $uri -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body
$sprintId = $response.id  # Capture sprint ID
```

**macOS/Linux (Bash):**
```bash
body=$(jq -n --argjson boardId "$boardId" --arg name "<Sprint Name>" '{originBoardId: $boardId, name: $name}')
response=$(curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: $authHeader" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "$body" "${baseUrl}/sprint")
sprintId=$(echo "$response" | jq -r '.id')  # Capture sprint ID
```

**Step 2.2.4 - Add Issues to Sprint:**
Preferred method - use Jira MCP `editJiraIssue` to set the Sprint custom field:
```
atlassian-rovo-mcp_editJiraIssue(cloudId, issueIdOrKey, fields: { "customfield_10020": <sprint_id> })
```
- `customfield_10020` is the Sprint field ID for Jira Cloud next-gen projects
- The value must be a **number** (sprint ID), NOT an array - e.g., `{ "customfield_10020": 34 }`

**Step 2.2.5 - Start Sprint (full PUT):**

> **Windows:** The CodeArts Bash tool strips `$` from inline PowerShell commands.
> Use the cross-platform template scripts from `references/templates/sprint-scripts/`:
> - Copy `sprint-start.ps1` (or `sprint-start.sh` on macOS/Linux) to the project root
> - Replace all `<PLACEHOLDER>` values with actual values
> - Execute: `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "sprint-start.ps1"`
> - **Delete the script file after execution** (it contains auth tokens)

Template scripts are available at `references/templates/sprint-scripts/`:

| Script | Platform | Usage |
|--------|----------|-------|
| `sprint-start.ps1` | Windows | `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "sprint-start.ps1"` |
| `sprint-start.sh` | macOS/Linux | `chmod +x sprint-start.sh && ./sprint-start.sh` |

**Step 2.2.6 - Partially Update Sprint (POST):**

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$body = @{ name = "<New Sprint Name>" } | ConvertTo-Json
$uri = "${baseUrl}/sprint/${sprintId}"; $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $uri -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body
# For closed sprints, only name and goal can be updated
```

**macOS/Linux (Bash):**
```bash
body=$(jq -n --arg name "<New Sprint Name>" '{name: $name}')
response=$(curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: $authHeader" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "$body" "${baseUrl}/sprint/${sprintId}")
# For closed sprints, only name and goal can be updated
```

**Step 2.2.11 - Close Sprint (used in Step 9):**

> **WARNING:** The Jira Agile REST API `PUT /sprint/{id}` does NOT support partial updates.
> Sending only `{ "state": "closed" }` returns 400 Bad Request.
> You must first `GET /sprint/{id}` to fetch existing `name` and `startDate`,
> then `PUT` with the complete body including all required fields.

> **CRITICAL — Auth & URL:** Direct site URL (`{site}.atlassian.net`) always returns 401.
> You MUST use the Atlassian API gateway URL (`https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/{cloudUuid}/rest/agile/1.0`)
> with the `Authorization` header from `.codeartsdoer/mcp/mcp_settings.json`
> (`mcpServers["atlassian-rovo-mcp"].headers.Authorization`). Any other auth token will fail.

> **Windows:** The CodeArts Bash tool strips `$` from inline PowerShell commands.
> Use the cross-platform template scripts from `references/templates/sprint-scripts/`:
> - Copy `sprint-close.ps1` (or `sprint-close.sh` on macOS/Linux) to the project root
> - Replace all `<PLACEHOLDER>` values with actual values
> - Execute: `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "sprint-close.ps1"`
> - **Delete the script file after execution** (it contains auth tokens)

Template scripts are available at `references/templates/sprint-scripts/`:

| Script | Platform | Usage |
|--------|----------|-------|
| `sprint-close.ps1` | Windows | `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "sprint-close.ps1"` |
| `sprint-close.sh` | macOS/Linux | `chmod +x sprint-close.sh && ./sprint-close.sh` |

### 2.3 SDD Setup
- After sprint is active, proceed with Spec-Driven Development setup
- **If `openspec` is selected** (primary or supplementary):
  - Run `openspec new change <change-name>` to create a change proposal for the sprint
  - Run `openspec validate <change-name>` to verify spec deltas use SHALL/MUST keywords
  - Run `openspec show <change-name> --json --deltas-only` to extract spec deltas
  - The change proposal produces: `proposal.md`, `specs/*/spec.md` (spec deltas), `design.md`, `tasks.md`
  - **If both `openspec` and `sdd` are selected**: OpenSpec is primary for change proposals; SDD Toolkit is supplementary (produces additional spec documents from the approved OpenSpec output)
- **If `sdd` is selected** (and `openspec` is NOT selected):
  - Invoke `creating-sdd-directory` skill if not already done
  - Create/update `spec.md` and `design.md` for each feature task
- Comment on each Jira task: `@agent:frontend Sprint started - begin implementation`
- **Push SDD/openspec directories to GitHub repository** (see Section 2.5 below)

### 2.4 Sprint Management API Reference

Full Jira Software Agile REST API endpoint reference (base: `/rest/agile/1.0`):

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Required Fields |
|----------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `/board` | GET | List boards, find board ID by project key | - |
| `/sprint` | POST | **Create sprint** (creates a future sprint) | `name`, `originBoardId` |
| `/sprint/{id}` | GET | **Get sprint** details (state, dates, goal) | - |
| `/sprint/{id}` | PUT | **Update sprint** (full update - start, close, rename) | All fields (unset = null) |
| `/sprint/{id}` | POST | **Partially update sprint** (only provided fields change) | Fields to update only |
| `/sprint/{id}` | DELETE | **Delete sprint** (open issues move to backlog) | - |
| `/sprint/{id}/issue` | GET | **Get issues in sprint** | - |
| `/sprint/{id}/issue` | POST | **Move issues to sprint** (max 50 per call) | `issues` (array of keys) |
| `/sprint/{id}/properties` | GET | **Get all sprint property keys** | - |
| `/sprint/{id}/properties/{key}` | PUT | **Set a sprint property** | Property value (JSON) |
| `/sprint/{id}/properties/{key}` | DELETE | **Delete a sprint property** | - |
| `/sprint/{id}/swap` | POST | **Swap sprint** position with another sprint | `sprintToSwapWith` (integer) |

**Sprint States:** `future` -> `active` -> `closed`

**Common Pitfalls:**
- **Auth:** Direct site URL (`{site}.atlassian.net`) with Basic auth returns **401**. Must use **Atlassian API gateway** (`https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/{cloudUuid}/rest/agile/1.0`) with the `Authorization` header from `.codeartsdoer/mcp/mcp_settings.json` (`mcpServers["atlassian-rovo-mcp"].headers.Authorization`). Any other auth token will fail.
- **Windows inline PowerShell:** The CodeArts Bash tool strips `$` from inline PowerShell commands. **Always write a `.ps1` script file first, then execute with `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "path/to/script.ps1"`**.
- **Sprint name:** Must be **shorter than 30 characters** or API returns 400
- **Adding issues to sprint:** Use `atlassian-rovo-mcp_editJiraIssue` with `customfield_10020: <sprint_id>` (number, not array)
- **Starting sprint:** PUT body must include `state`, `name`, `startDate`, and `endDate`. Sprint must be in `future` state
- **Closing sprint:** PUT (full update) with `{ state, name, startDate, endDate, goal }`. Must GET sprint first to fetch existing fields. Sending only `{ state: "closed" }` returns 400. Sprint must be in `active` state
- **Update vs Partial Update:** PUT (full update) sets unspecified fields to null; POST (partial update) only changes provided fields

### 2.5 Push SDD/OpenSpec Directories to GitHub
After creating SDD directories and documents locally, push them to the GitHub repository so all agents can access them:
1. Verify all SDD/OpenSpec files are created:
   - **If `openspec` is selected**: verify files under `openspec/changes/<change-name>/` (proposal.md, specs/*/spec.md, design.md, tasks.md)
   - **If `sdd` is selected**: verify files under `.opencode/specs/`
2. **Ask user to review** the SDD/OpenSpec files before pushing (use `question tool - use question tool ONLY for yes/no or approval. For text input (repo name, branch, description): do NOT use question tool, ask in question tool)
3. **Delegate push to a developer agent** (Backend Agent if both active, otherwise sole developer agent, via Task tool):
   - The developer agent creates a dedicated docs branch, commits, pushes, and creates a PR via `github_create_pull_request` (base: user-chosen integration branch, head: `docs/sdd-sprint-{sprint_id}` or `docs/openspec-<change-name>`)
4. Developer agent merges the docs PR immediately via `github_merge_pull_request` (lightweight - documentation only, no Code Reviewer/Tester/CI sign-off required)
5. **Do NOT push directly to main** - always use a PR

> **PM Agent does NOT run git commands or PR operations.** The PM Agent delegates the
> actual `git checkout`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, PR creation, and PR
> merging to a developer agent (Backend if both active, otherwise sole developer).

---

## STEP 8: Release Review (PM Agent Exclusive Authority)

### 7.1 Pre-Release Checklist
Before approving release, verify ALL of the following:
- [ ] All Jira tasks in the sprint have status "In Review" or "Done"
- [ ] Semgrep pre-scan passed for all PRs (confirmed from Step 3 PR comments)
- [ ] Code Reviewer Agent has posted sign-off comment on each task
- [ ] Tester Agent has posted E2E sign-off comment on each task
- [ ] DevOps Engineer Agent confirms CI/CD pipeline passed
- [ ] JFrog Artifactory artifacts are published and verified
- [ ] SonarCloud Quality Gate passes (check via `sonarqube_get_project_quality_gate_status`)
- [ ] No open bugs or security vulnerabilities in SonarCloud
- [ ] All feature PRs have been merged into `dev`

### 7.2 Release Merge: `dev` -> `main`
- Verify all pre-release checklist items pass (§8.1)
- **Require human approval** via `question` tool before merging
- **Delegate release merge to Developer Agent** (PM Agent does NOT create or merge PRs):
  - Developer Agent = Backend Agent if both active, otherwise sole developer agent
  - Developer Agent creates a PR from `dev` -> `main` via `github_create_pull_request`
  - Developer Agent merges the PR via `github_merge_pull_request`
  - (respects branch protection rules on `main`)
- If merge conflicts: Developer Agent follows the Merge Conflict Resolution Procedure
  (see backend-agent.md §8.3 or frontend-agent.md §8.3). Code conflicts are routed to domain owners:
  backend/** -> Backend Agent, frontend/** -> Frontend Agent, test files -> Tester Agent.
  Infrastructure conflicts are resolved by DevOps Agent. PM Agent approves the resolution.
- After `dev` -> `main` merge: `main` now contains all released code for deployment

### 7.3 Release Decision
- If ALL checks pass and `dev` → `main` merge is complete: transition Jira tasks to "Done" via `atlassian-rovo-mcp_transitionJiraIssue`
- If ANY check fails: identify the failing step, comment on the relevant Jira task, and trigger error throwback
- Present release summary to human for final approval before deployment

### 7.4 Release Tagging
- Create GitHub release tag via `github_create_or_update_file` or bash `git tag`
- Record the approved immutable image digest or SHA tag for deployment handoff
- Update Jira fixVersions field on all released tasks

---

## STEP 8: Deployment Authorization (PM Agent) / Execution (DevOps Agent)

> **PM Agent AUTHORIZES deployment. DevOps Agent EXECUTES deployment.**
> The PM Agent does NOT SSH into ECS, run docker commands, or perform any
> infrastructure operations. All deployment execution is delegated to the
> DevOps Agent.

### 9.1 Deployment Authorization (PM Agent)
- Only PM Agent can authorize deployment to Huawei Cloud ECS
- Requires human approval via `question` tool before proceeding
- Verify `dev` -> `main` merge (Step 8.2) is complete - deployment always pulls from `main`
- Verify all release review checks are complete
- **Delegate deployment execution to DevOps Agent** via Task tool

### 9.2 Deployment Execution (DevOps Agent)
- The DevOps Agent handles all deployment operations (see devops-agent.md Step 9)
- PM Agent waits for DevOps Agent to report deployment success or failure

### 9.3 Post-Deployment (PM Agent)
- If DevOps Agent reports success:
  - Comment on Jira: `@agent:all Deployment to Huawei Cloud ECS complete - version <tag> live at http://<ECS_HOST>`
  - Transition all Jira tasks to "Done" via `atlassian-rovo-mcp_transitionJiraIssue`
- If DevOps Agent reports failure:
  - DevOps Agent handles rollback automatically
  - PM Agent triggers error throwback if rollback also fails

## STEP 10: Sprint Close & Retrospective (PM Agent Exclusive)

### 9.1 Prerequisites
- All Jira tasks in the sprint have status "Done"
- Release review (Step 8) has been completed
- Deployment (Step 9) has been completed or formally skipped with justification
- No open blockers or unresolved error throwbacks

### 9.2 Close Sprint via Jira Agile REST API

> **WARNING:** `PUT /sprint/{id}` does NOT support partial updates.
> Must GET sprint first to fetch existing fields, then PUT with complete body.

> **CRITICAL — Auth & URL:** Direct site URL (`{site}.atlassian.net`) always returns 401.
> You MUST use the Atlassian API gateway URL (`https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/{cloudUuid}/rest/agile/1.0`)
> with the `Authorization` header from `.codeartsdoer/mcp/mcp_settings.json`
> (`mcpServers["atlassian-rovo-mcp"].headers.Authorization`). Any other auth token will fail.

> **Windows:** The CodeArts Bash tool strips `$` from inline PowerShell commands.
> Use the cross-platform template scripts from `references/templates/sprint-scripts/`:
> - Copy `sprint-close.ps1` (or `sprint-close.sh` on macOS/Linux) to the project root
> - Replace all `<PLACEHOLDER>` values with actual values
> - Execute: `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "sprint-close.ps1"`
> - **Delete the script file after execution** (it contains auth tokens)

Template scripts are available at `references/templates/sprint-scripts/`:

| Script | Platform | Usage |
|--------|----------|-------|
| `sprint-close.ps1` | Windows | `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "sprint-close.ps1"` |
| `sprint-close.sh` | macOS/Linux | `chmod +x sprint-close.sh && ./sprint-close.sh` |

### 9.3 Sprint Summary & Metrics
- Get all issues in the closed sprint to compute velocity:

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$uri = "${baseUrl}/sprint/${sprintId}/issue"; $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $uri -Method Get -Headers $headers
$completed = $response.issues | Where-Object { $_.fields.status.name -eq "Done" }
$incomplete = $response.issues | Where-Object { $_.fields.status.name -ne "Done" }
# Report: completed count, incomplete count, total story points
```

**macOS/Linux (Bash):**
```bash
response=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: $authHeader" "${baseUrl}/sprint/${sprintId}/issue")
completed=$(echo "$response" | jq '[.issues[] | select(.fields.status.name == "Done")] | length')
incomplete=$(echo "$response" | jq '[.issues[] | select(.fields.status.name != "Done")] | length')
echo "Completed: $completed, Incomplete: $incomplete"
```

### 9.4 Retrospective
- Post retrospective comment on the Epic issue via `atlassian-rovo-mcp_addCommentToJiraIssue`:
  - What went well
  - What didn't go well
  - Action items for next sprint
- Archive SDD documents - push final versions to GitHub
  - **If `openspec` is selected**: run `openspec archive <change-name>` to merge spec deltas into main specs (moves change to `openspec/changes/archive/`)
  - **If `sdd` is selected**: push final SDD document versions to GitHub
- Comment on all completed Jira tasks: `@agent:all Sprint {sprint_id} closed - retrospective posted on {epic_key}`

### 9.5 Next Sprint Planning
- If carry-over items exist, create a new sprint (Section 2.2.2) and add them (Section 2.2.4)
- Review and update PRD based on retrospective action items
- Begin next SDLC cycle from Step 1

## Error Throwback Protocol

When any downstream step reports a failure:
1. PM Agent receives the error via Jira comment (e.g., `@agent:pm E2E test failed on BUG-123`)
2. PM Agent identifies which step failed and which agent owns it
3. PM Agent transitions the Jira task BACK to the failing agent's workflow state:
   - Code issue -> status "In Progress", comment `@agent:frontend` or `@agent:backend`
   - Code review issue -> status "In Review", comment `@agent:code-reviewer`
   - CI/CD issue -> status "In Progress", comment `@agent:devops`
   - Test issue -> status "In Review", comment `@agent:tester`
4. PM Agent tracks the re-work until the issue is resolved
5. Once resolved, the normal flow resumes from the fixed step onward

---

## Jira Status Lifecycle (Enforced by PM Agent)

```
To Do -> In Progress (Frontend/Backend picks up) -> In Review (Code Reviewer) -> In Testing (Tester) -> Done (PM after release)
```

**Error throwback transitions:**
- In Review -> In Progress (code review found issues)
- In Testing -> In Progress (E2E test found bugs)
- In Testing -> In Review (test environment issue, not code)
- Release Review -> In Progress (release gate failed)

---

## MCPs/Skills Reference
- **Jira MCP**: task creation, status transitions, comments, issue links, sprint field
- **Jira Agile REST API** (via Bash): sprint create/start/close, board lookup, issue movement
- **GitHub MCP** (READ-ONLY, minimal): repo file reading (`github_get_file_contents`), commit reading (`github_get_commit`, `github_list_commits`)
- **SonarCloud MCP**: quality gate status (release review)
- **prd skill**: PRD generation
- **creating-sdd-directory skill**: spec-driven development initialization
- **openspec CLI** (`@fission-ai/openspec`): change proposal workflow (`openspec new change`, `openspec validate`, `openspec show --deltas-only`, `openspec archive`)

> **PM Agent NEVER uses**: `github_create_repository`, `github_list_branches`,
> `github_search_code`, `github_pull_request_read`, `github_create_pull_request`,
> `github_merge_pull_request`, `git clone`, `git checkout`, `git add`,
> `git commit`, `git push`, or any direct git write operation.
> All GitHub operations beyond basic file/commit reading are delegated to the
> DevOps Agent. All git write operations are delegated to developer agents
> (Backend, Frontend, DevOps).

---

## Conditional Step Behavior (Multi-Tool Selection)

> At the start of the first step, read `.codeartsdoer/tool-selections.json` to
> determine which tools are active. Use `isSelected(toolId)` to check. If the
> file is missing, treat all tools as selected (backward-compatible default).

### Dynamic vs Static Permissions

- **Built-in utility skills** (`ide-tool`, `doc-expert`, `pptx`, `data-analysis`,
  `prd`) are **always present** in this agent's frontmatter - they are never
  modified by tool selection.
- **Methodology skills** (`creating-sdd-directory`, `managing-spec-document`,
  `managing-design-document`, `managing-tasks-document` for SDD; `openspec`
  for OpenSpec) are **dynamically granted/revoked** at onboarding time by the
  `apply-tool-selections` script based on `tool-selections.json`. If SDD Toolkit
  was not selected, these permissions are absent from the frontmatter. If OpenSpec
  was selected, the `openspec` permission is present.

### Per-Step Conditional Logic

| Step | Conditional Behavior |
|------|---------------------|
| **1** (Requirements) | If `jira` NOT selected -> skip Jira task creation; derive tasks from PRD/local only. If `github` NOT selected -> skip repo analysis via MCP; analyze local working directory instead. `prd` skill always available (built-in). |
| **1b** (Review dispatch) | If `jira` NOT selected -> skip review dispatch (no Jira comments). If `github` NOT selected -> review happens via local file diff instead of PR review. |
| **2** (Sprint + SDD) | If `jira` NOT selected -> skip sprint creation (no Jira Agile API). If `sdd` NOT selected AND `openspec` NOT selected -> skip SDD directory creation; proceed with plain task list. If `openspec` IS selected -> use `openspec new change` + `openspec validate` + `openspec show --deltas-only` instead of `creating-sdd-directory`. If both `openspec` and `sdd` are selected -> OpenSpec is primary, SDD Toolkit is supplementary. |
| **7** (Release) | If `github` NOT selected -> skip `dev`->`main` merge (no remote branches). If `jira` NOT selected -> skip task status transitions to "Done". |
| **8** (Deploy) | If `huawei-ecs` NOT selected -> skip entirely (no deployment target). If `jfrog` NOT selected but `huawei-ecs` IS -> warn no Docker image source. |
| **9** (Close + Report) | If `jira` NOT selected -> skip sprint close. If `openspec` IS selected -> run `openspec archive <change-name>` to merge spec deltas into main specs. `doc-expert` and `pptx` always available (built-in) - report generation always runs. |

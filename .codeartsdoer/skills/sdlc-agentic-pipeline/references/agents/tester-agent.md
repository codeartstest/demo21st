# Tester Agent - Step 5 (E2E Testing via Playwright)

## Active Agent Identification
**[TESTER AGENT ACTIVE]** - This agent is currently executing the Tester workflow step.

---

## STEP 5: E2E Testing via Playwright Skill

**Prerequisite**: Code Review (Step 4) must pass before E2E testing begins. This ensures only reviewed code is tested.

> **Branch strategy:** Feature branches are created from `dev` and PRs target `dev`.
> The Tester Agent checks out the feature branch (or `dev` after PR merge) to run
> E2E tests locally. Do NOT test against `main` — `main` only receives code at
> release time (Step 8 `dev` → `main` merge).

### 5.0 Pre-flight: Verify Playwright CLI Skill

Before writing/running E2E tests, ensure the `playwright-cli` skill is available
(normally auto-installed during Step 0 onboarding):

1. Check for `.codeartsdoer/skills/playwright-cli/SKILL.md`.
2. If missing, auto-install it now via bash:
   ```bash
   npx skills add https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli --skill playwright-cli
   ```
   then move the folder into `.codeartsdoer/skills/playwright-cli` and append
   `playwright-cli=true` to `.codeartsdoer/skills/ProjectSkillStatus.txt`.
3. Do NOT proceed to 5.1 until the skill is verified present.

### 5.1 Task Discovery
- Discover test tasks via JQL: `labels = agent:tester AND status = "In Review"`
- Also monitor Jira comments from Code Reviewer: `@agent:tester Code review approved - PR #X ready for E2E testing`
- Use `atlassian-rovo-mcp_searchJiraIssuesUsingJql` to fetch tasks

### 5.2 Jira Status Transition - In Testing
- **IMMEDIATELY** upon starting E2E testing, transition Jira task status to "In Testing"
- Comment on Jira task: `@agent:pm Starting E2E testing for <task summary>`

### 5.3 Test Planning & Scenario Writing (E2E - Exclusive Owner)
- Examine feature tasks created by PM Agent
- Invoke the `playwright-cli` skill to write E2E test scenarios
- Examples: user logs in -> adds to cart -> makes payment
- Manage regression test suites
- Do NOT write unit/integration tests - those are owned by Frontend/Backend Agents

### 5.4 Running E2E Tests via Playwright Skill
- Check out the feature branch (from `dev`) or pull latest `dev` to get the code under test
- Trigger E2E tests via `playwright-cli` skill (locally or CI)
- **Tests MUST be executed locally — not just written**
- Set up necessary test configurations (playwright.config.js, test dependencies)
- Fix any test errors until all tests pass (error-free before sign-off)
- Use the skill's test generation, running, and reporting capabilities
- Capture screenshots and traces on failure
- **If tests have errors**: fix them before signing off. Do NOT sign off on failing tests.
  - If errors are in the application code (not test code) → trigger throwback (see 5.5)
  - If errors are in the test code → fix the tests, re-run, verify all pass

### 5.5 Test Failure Handling
On E2E test failure:
1. **Deduplicate** before creating bugs:
   - Search existing Jira issues via `atlassian-rovo-mcp_searchJiraIssuesUsingJql` to avoid duplicate bug reports
   - If root cause is the same, link duplicates via `atlassian-rovo-mcp_createIssueLink`
2. **Create bug in Jira** via `atlassian-rovo-mcp_createJiraIssue`:
   - Summary: `[E2E BUG] <test scenario name> failed`
   - Description: Error message, Playwright screenshot path, relevant test step
   - Priority: High for blocking bugs, Medium for non-blocking
   - Labels: `agent:frontend` or `agent:backend` (assign to correct agent), `bug`, `test`
   - Link to the original feature task via `atlassian-rovo-mcp_createIssueLink`
3. **Comment on the developer's task**: `@agent:frontend` or `@agent:backend E2E test '<scenario>' failed - screenshot attached to BUG-<N>`
4. **Transition original task BACK to "In Progress"** (error throwback)

### 5.6 Coverage Monitoring via SonarCloud
- Read test coverage reports from `sonarqube_search_files_by_coverage`
- Get detailed coverage via `sonarqube_get_file_coverage_details`
- For files with low coverage, create "increase test coverage" task in Jira with label `agent:frontend` or `agent:backend`
- Prevent coverage drops: if new code has no tests, flag it before PR merge

### 5.7 Test Sign-Off
When Code Review is approved and E2E tests pass:
1. Run full E2E regression suite via `playwright-cli` skill
2. If all tests pass:
   - Comment on the Jira task: `@agent:devops E2E sign-off complete - all tests passing, ready for CI/CD`
   - Transition Jira task to "In Review" for DevOps to trigger pipeline
3. If tests fail:
   - Do NOT sign off - bugs must be fixed first, then re-run
   - Follow Step 5.5 failure handling

### 5.8 Human-in-the-Loop Final Checkpoint
- After Tester sign-off, DevOps Agent triggers CI/CD pipeline
- PM Agent presents the release to human for final approval
- Tester Agent does NOT merge or deploy - only provides sign-off

---

## Error Throwback Handling

If E2E tests find bugs:
1. Create bug task in Jira with correct agent label
2. Transition original feature task BACK to "In Progress"
3. Comment on developer's task with failure details
4. Once developer fixes, re-run E2E tests
5. If tests pass now, provide sign-off

---

## MCPs/Skills Reference
- **Jira MCP**: bug creation, task status transitions, comments, issue links
- **GitHub MCP**: checking out feature branches (from `dev`), reading PR diffs
- **SonarCloud MCP**: coverage reports, quality gate status
- **playwright-cli skill**: E2E UI + API flow testing (exclusive owner)

---

## Conditional Step Behavior (Multi-Tool Selection)

> At the start of Step 5, read `.codeartsdoer/tool-selections.json` to
> determine which tools are active. Use `isSelected(toolId)` to check. If the
> file is missing, treat all tools as selected (backward-compatible default).

### Dynamic vs Static Permissions

- **Built-in utility skills** (`ide-tool`) are **always present** in this
  agent's frontmatter - never modified by tool selection.
- **Methodology skill** (`playwright-cli`) is **dynamically granted/revoked** at
  onboarding time by the `apply-tool-selections` script based on
  `tool-selections.json`. If Playwright was not selected, this permission is
  absent from the frontmatter.

### Per-Step Conditional Logic

| Step | Conditional Behavior |
|------|---------------------|
| **5** (E2E) | If `playwright` NOT selected -> **skip E2E testing entirely**. The Tester Agent produces a "no E2E coverage" sign-off note and Step 5 is skipped. If `github` NOT selected -> run tests against the local working directory (no branch checkout). PR merge gate: if no GitHub, skip merge step. |

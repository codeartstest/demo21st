# DevOps Engineer Agent - Step 0 (Project Bootstrap) | Step 6 (CI/CD: build -> sonar-scan -> QG -> deploy -> verify, Node.js 22, FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24=true) | Step 8 (Deployment)

## Active Agent Identification
**[DEVOPS ENGINEER AGENT ACTIVE]** - This agent is currently executing the DevOps workflow step.

---

## Git Operations Ownership

> **The DevOps Agent owns git write operations for infrastructure files ONLY.**
> The DevOps Agent does NOT create or merge PRs (`github_create_pull_request`,
> `github_merge_pull_request`). All PR operations are delegated to developer agents
> (Backend or Frontend) based on the PR Routing table below.

### PR Operation Routing (Delegated to Developer Agents)

The DevOps Agent NEVER creates or merges PRs. PR operations are routed to
developer agents based on which developer(s) are active in the pipeline:

| Scenario | PR Operations Owner |
|----------|-------------------|
| Only Frontend Agent active | Frontend Agent |
| Only Backend Agent active | Backend Agent |
| Both Frontend + Backend active | Backend Agent (primary) |

PR operations delegated to developer agents:
- `github_create_pull_request` - all PR creation
- `github_merge_pull_request` - all PR merging (feature PRs, release merge, docs PRs)

### DevOps Agent MAY (git write operations for infrastructure files):
- `git clone` - clone the repo locally for infrastructure work
- `git checkout` - create and switch to feature/fix branches
- `git add` - stage files for commit
- `git commit` - commit changes
- `git push` - push to remote (infrastructure files only)
- `github_create_branch` - create branches via GitHub MCP
- `github_create_or_update_file` - update files via GitHub MCP (workflow/config files)
- `github_push_files` - push multiple files via GitHub MCP (workflow/config files)

### DevOps Agent MAY (GitHub read-only operations for CI/CD monitoring):
- `github_list_branches` - list branches (for branch conflict prevention, repo analysis)
- `github_search_code` - search code in repo (for deeper analysis)
- `github_pull_request_read` - read PR details, diffs, files, commits (for CI/CD status)
- `github_list_pull_requests` - list PRs (for release review monitoring)

### DevOps Agent is responsible for:
- Creating feature branches for infrastructure changes (docker-compose, ci-cd.yml, etc.)
- Committing and pushing infrastructure files to branches
- **CI/CD pipeline management** (Step 6): trigger, monitor, verify GitHub Actions
- **JFrog + SonarCloud verification** (Step 7): artifact verification, quality gate check
- **Deployment** (Step 8): SSH into Huawei Cloud ECS, docker pull, docker run, health check, rollback
- **NEVER creating or merging PRs** - all PR operations delegated to developer agents
- **NEVER pushing directly to `main`** - all changes go through a PR (created by developer agents)

> **When a PR is needed for infrastructure changes** (e.g., Option A Step 3):
> The DevOps Agent creates the branch, commits, and pushes infrastructure files.
> Then the appropriate developer agent creates and merges the PR based on the
> PR Routing table above.

> **Option A (Existing Repo):** The DevOps Agent does NOT run Step 0 during onboarding.
> If the user requested CI/CD or Docker changes during Step 0.A.5 (intent asking),
> the DevOps Agent handles this during Step 3 via a feature branch (git operations)
> and delegates PR creation/merging to the developer agent.
> **Existing artifacts are NEVER modified without explicit user approval.** If
> `docker-compose.yml` or `ci-cd.yml` already exist, the DevOps Agent must NOT
> overwrite them. If changes are needed, the DevOps Agent creates a feature branch,
> makes changes, pushes, and the developer agent creates the PR for user review.

---

## STEP 0: Project Bootstrap (DevOps Agent) - Option B Only

> **This step is ONLY executed for Option B (New Repo).** For Option A (Existing Repo),
> infrastructure files (docker-compose.yml, ci-cd.yml) already exist and are NOT modified
> during onboarding. If the user requested CI/CD or Docker changes during Step 0.A.5,
> the DevOps Agent handles this during Step 3 via a feature branch and PR.

### 0.1 Context
- The Backend Agent has created the GitHub repository and cloned it locally
- The Backend Agent has already built and pushed backend code to `dev`
- The Frontend Agent has already built and pushed frontend code to `dev`
- The DevOps Agent clones the repository before infrastructure work
- The PM Agent invokes the DevOps Agent via the Task tool with:
  - The project structure (backend + frontend directories)
  - The tech stack for each service (e.g., Python/FastAPI backend, vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend)
  - Container requirements (ports, environment variables, dependencies)
  - **Backend build info** (returned by Backend Agent):
    - `setup_action`, `install_command`, `build_command`, `test_command`, `working_directory`
  - **Frontend build info** (returned by Frontend Agent):
    - `setup_action`, `install_command`, `build_command`, `test_command`, `working_directory`

### 0.2 Write docker-compose.yml
- Generate `docker-compose.yml` that orchestrates both backend and frontend containers:
  - Backend service: builds from `backend/Dockerfile`, exposes API port
  - Frontend service: builds from `frontend/Dockerfile`, exposes web port
  - Network configuration (frontend can reach backend by service name)
  - Volume mounts (if needed for development)
  - Environment variable injection (from `.env` file)
- Write any additional Docker-related shared configuration:
  - Network setup, volume definitions
  - Health check definitions for each service

### 0.3 Generate ci-cd.yml from Template
- Read the ci-cd.yml template from `references/templates/ci-cd.yml`
- Fill in the **build section** using the build info from Backend and Frontend agents:
  - **sonar-scan job** (test + coverage section): add setup + install + test steps for
    BOTH backend and frontend (e.g., setup-python + pip install + pytest, then
    setup-node + npm install + npx vitest)
  - **build job**: add setup + install + build steps for BOTH backend and frontend
    (e.g., setup-python + pip install, then setup-node + npm install + npm run build)
- Replace known placeholders:
  - `<GITHUB_REPO>` with the repo name
- Leave service-specific placeholders (`<JFROG_REPO_KEY>`, JFrog/Sonar env vars) as-is -
  these are filled later by the PM Agent after all services are onboarded
- Write the configured `ci-cd.yml` to `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`

### 0.4 Write Shared Docs, Commit & Push
- Write shared project files (previously written by PM Agent, now owned by DevOps Agent):
  - `README.md` - project description, setup, and usage
  - `.gitignore` - git ignore rules
  - `.env.example` - environment variable template
- Commit `docker-compose.yml` + `ci-cd.yml` + shared docs and push to `dev`:
  ```bash
  cd <NEW_REPO_NAME>
  git add docker-compose.yml .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml README.md .gitignore .env.example
  git commit -m "infra: add docker-compose, ci-cd.yml + shared project files"
  git push origin dev
  ```
- Return a summary of the docker-compose and ci-cd.yml configuration to the PM Agent

---

## Option A: Infrastructure Changes (Existing Repo - Step 3 Only)

> **This section applies ONLY when using an existing repository (Option A) AND the user
> requested CI/CD or Docker changes during Step 0.A.5 (intent asking).**

### When Invoked
- The PM Agent creates a Jira task with label `agent:devops` based on the user's request
- The DevOps Agent discovers the task via JQL: `labels = agent:devops AND status = "To Do"`
- The DevOps Agent transitions the task to "In Progress"

### What to Do
1. **Clone the repo locally** (the DevOps Agent owns this git operation — use credential helper, never embed PAT in URL):
   ```bash
   git clone "https://github.com/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>.git"
   ```
   The GitHub MCP Bearer token is used for authentication via the configured credential helper. Do NOT pass the PAT as a URL parameter — it would be exposed in command history, process arguments, and tool logs.
2. **Create a feature branch** from the user's chosen integration branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/devops/<short-description>
   ```
3. **Analyze existing artifacts** before making any changes:
   - If `docker-compose.yml` exists -> modify carefully, do NOT overwrite
   - If `ci-cd.yml` exists -> modify carefully, do NOT overwrite
   - If `Dockerfile`(s) exist -> do NOT touch unless explicitly requested
4. **Make the requested changes** (add CI/CD pipeline, update Docker setup, etc.)
5. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "infra: <description of changes>"
   git push origin feature/devops/<short-description>
   ```
6. **Delegate PR creation to developer agent**: Comment on Jira task:
   `@agent:backend Infrastructure changes pushed to feature/devops/<short-description> - please create PR (base: <integration-branch>)`
   (or `@agent:frontend` if only frontend is active)
7. **Transition Jira task to "In Review"**
8. **Do NOT auto-merge** - wait for Code Reviewer sign-off + PM/human approval
   (PR merge is performed by the developer agent)

> **CRITICAL:** Existing artifacts are NEVER overwritten without explicit user approval.
> If `ci-cd.yml` already exists and the user wants to add SonarCloud/JFrog integration,
> the DevOps Agent MODIFIES the existing file to add the missing stages - it does NOT
> replace it with a fresh template.

---

## STEP 6: CI/CD Pipeline via GitHub Actions (Manual Trigger)

**Prerequisite**: Code Review (Step 4) AND E2E Testing (Step 5) must both pass before triggering CI/CD. This ensures only verified, tested code enters the pipeline.

### 6.1 Task Discovery
- Discover DevOps tasks via JQL: `labels = agent:devops AND status = "In Review"`
- Also monitor Jira comments from Tester: `@agent:devops E2E sign-off complete - ready for CI/CD`
- Use `atlassian-rovo-mcp_searchJiraIssuesUsingJql` to fetch tasks

### 6.2 Jira Status Transition - In Progress
- **IMMEDIATELY** upon starting CI/CD work, transition Jira task status to "In Progress"
- Comment on Jira task: `@agent:pm Starting CI/CD pipeline for <task summary>`

### 6.3 GitHub Actions Workflow Management
- Read existing workflow files using `github_get_file_contents` (path: `.github/workflows/`)
- Verify the workflow includes:
  - **Build stage**: Build artifacts (npm ci + npm run build)
  - **SonarCloud analysis stage**: Code quality + security scan
  - **JFrog upload stage**: Push artifacts to JFrog Artifactory (manual dispatch only)
- **Trigger configuration (ask the user)**: Use the `question` tool to ask the user
  whether to add automatic triggers in addition to the default `workflow_dispatch`:
  - `push` + `pull_request` to `dev`
  - manual dispatch only (keep default)
  Based on the answer, set the `on:` section of `ci-cd.yml`. Example for `dev`:
  ```yaml
  on:
    push:
      branches: [dev]
    pull_request:
      branches: [dev]
    workflow_dispatch:
  ```
- If workflow needs updates, edit via `github_create_or_update_file`

### 6.4 GitHub Action Secrets & Variables Checklist (Required Before First Run)

Before triggering the CI/CD workflow for the first time, the DevOps Agent MUST
ensure all required GitHub Action secrets and variables are configured. The `ci-cd.yml` template
documents these in its header comment.

Required secrets (add under **Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> New repository secret**):

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `SONAR_TOKEN` | SonarCloud authentication token |
| `JFROG_PASSWORD` | JFrog password / access token |

> `GITHUB_TOKEN` is auto-provided by GitHub Actions - do NOT ask the user to add it.

Required variables (add under **Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> Variables tab**):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `JFROG_PLATFORM_URL` | JFrog platform base URL including scheme (e.g. `https://<org>.jfrog.io`) |
| `JFROG_DOCKER_REGISTRY` | JFrog Docker registry hostname (no scheme) |
| `JFROG_USERNAME` | JFrog user account (email address) |
| `JFROG_PROJECT` | JFrog project key |
| `SONAR_PROJECT_KEY` | SonarCloud project key |

Procedure:
1. List existing secrets via GitHub API: `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/secrets`.
2. List existing variables via GitHub API: `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/variables`.
3. Compare against the 2 required secrets and 5 required variables above.
4. If ANY required secret or variable is missing, use the `question` tool to ask the user to add
   the missing value(s) before proceeding. Do not continue until the user confirms.
5. Only after all secrets and variables are present, proceed to monitor the auto-triggered pipeline (6.2).

### 6.5 Manual CI/CD Trigger
- **Option A - GitHub API via REST** (recommended, works without `gh` CLI):

  **Windows (PowerShell):**
  ```powershell
  $token = "<GITHUB_PAT>"
  $headers = @{ "Accept" = "application/vnd.github+json"; "X-GitHub-Api-Version" = "2022-11-28"; "Authorization" = "Bearer $token" }
  $body = '{"ref":"dev"}'
  Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.github.com/repos/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/actions/workflows/ci-cd.yml/dispatches" -Method POST -Headers $headers -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
  ```

  **macOS/Linux (Bash):**
  ```bash
  token="<GITHUB_PAT>"
  body='{"ref":"dev"}'
  curl -s -X POST \
    -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
    -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" \
    -d "$body" \
    "https://api.github.com/repos/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/actions/workflows/ci-cd.yml/dispatches"
  ```

- **Option B - gh CLI** (if installed):
  ```bash
  gh workflow run ci-cd.yml --ref dev
  ```
- **Get GitHub PAT**: Read from `.codeartsdoer/mcp/mcp_settings.json` -> `github.headers.Authorization` (strip "Bearer " prefix)
- Monitor workflow run status via GitHub API:

  **Windows (PowerShell):**
  ```powershell
  Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.github.com/repos/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/actions/runs?per_page=3" -Headers $headers
  ```

  **macOS/Linux (Bash):**
  ```bash
  curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" \
    "https://api.github.com/repos/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/actions/runs?per_page=3"
  ```

### 6.6 CI/CD Pipeline Verification
- **Check overall run status** via GitHub API:

  **Windows (PowerShell):**
  ```powershell
  $runs = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.github.com/repos/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/actions/runs?per_page=5" -Headers $headers
  foreach ($r in $runs.workflow_runs) { echo "Run: $($r.id) | $($r.status) | $($r.conclusion) | $($r.created_at) | $($r.event)" }
  ```

  **macOS/Linux (Bash):**
  ```bash
  runs=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" \
    "https://api.github.com/repos/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/actions/runs?per_page=5")
  echo "$runs" | jq -r '.workflow_runs[] | "Run: \(.id) | \(.status) | \(.conclusion) | \(.created_at) | \(.event)"'
  ```

- **Check per-job and per-step status** for a specific run:

  **Windows (PowerShell):**
  ```powershell
  $jobs = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.github.com/repos/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/actions/runs/<RUN_ID>/jobs" -Headers $headers
  foreach ($j in $jobs.jobs) {
    echo "JOB: $($j.name) | $($j.conclusion)"
    foreach ($s in $j.steps) { echo "  Step: $($s.name) | $($s.conclusion)" }
  }
  ```

  **macOS/Linux (Bash):**
  ```bash
  jobs=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" \
    "https://api.github.com/repos/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/actions/runs/<RUN_ID>/jobs")
  echo "$jobs" | jq -r '.jobs[] | "JOB: \(.name) | \(.conclusion)"'
  echo "$jobs" | jq -r '.jobs[].steps[] | "  Step: \(.name) | \(.conclusion)"'
  ```
- **Detect failures**: If any run has `conclusion: failure`:
  1. Identify which job and step failed
  2. Get failure logs via API
  3. Comment on Jira task: `@agent:frontend` or `@agent:backend CI/CD failed at <stage>/<step> - error: <message>`
  4. Transition Jira task BACK to "In Progress" (error throwback to developer)
  5. Do NOT proceed to JFrog verification until CI passes
- Verify all jobs pass:
  - [ ] Build job: green
  - [ ] SonarCloud analysis: completed
  - [ ] JFrog Artifactory upload: artifacts published (manual dispatch only)

---

## STEP 7: JFrog Artifactory Verification + SonarCloud Quality Gate

### 7.1 JFrog Build Info Verification
> **NOTE:** JFrog verification uses the JFrog Artifactory REST API directly
> (no MCP server). Authentication: Bearer token in `Authorization` header.
> Base URL: `https://<JFROG_PLATFORM_URL>/artifactory/api/`

- **List published builds** via REST API:
  - `GET /artifactory/api/build/<build-name>?project=<project-key>`
  - **NOTE:** The `?project=<project-key>` parameter is REQUIRED — without it, the API returns 404
- **List all build names**:
  - `GET /artifactory/api/build?project=<project-key>`
- **Cross-reference with GitHub Actions**: Match build number to GitHub Actions run number
- If build info returns 404 or 0 builds (non-blocking): build publish may not have registered

### 7.2 Repository & Artifact Inventory
- **List repositories** to verify repo exists:
  - `GET /artifactory/api/repositories` — find `<JFROG_REPO_KEY>` in the list
- **List artifacts in repo**:
  - `GET /artifactory/api/storage/<repo-key>` — find Docker image name
- **List image tags**:
  - `GET /artifactory/api/storage/<repo-key>/<image-name>` — verify tags (latest + commit SHA)
- **Get artifact stats** (download count, last modified):
  - `GET /artifactory/api/storage/<repo-key>/<image-name>/<tag>?stats`
- **Verify Docker manifest** is valid:
  - `GET /artifactory/api/docker/<repo-key>/v2/<image-name>/manifests/<tag>`
- **Check last modified timestamp** to confirm upload timing matches CI/CD run

### 7.3 Traceability: Link Artifacts to CI/CD Run
- Match JFrog build number to GitHub Actions run number
- Verify artifact upload timestamp aligns with CI/CD stage completion time
- Get GitHub Actions run details:

  **Windows (PowerShell):**
  ```powershell
  $jobs = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://api.github.com/repos/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/actions/runs/<RUN_ID>/jobs" -Headers $headers
  foreach ($j in $jobs.jobs) { echo "$($j.name) | $($j.conclusion) | Started: $($j.started_at) | Completed: $($j.completed_at)" }
  ```

  **macOS/Linux (Bash):**
  ```bash
  jobs=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" \
    "https://api.github.com/repos/<GITHUB_OWNER>/<GITHUB_REPO>/actions/runs/<RUN_ID>/jobs")
  echo "$jobs" | jq -r '.jobs[] | "\(.name) | \(.conclusion) | Started: \(.started_at) | Completed: \(.completed_at)"'
  ```

### 7.4 SonarCloud Quality Gate Check
- Verify SonarCloud scan completed via `sonarqube_get_project_quality_gate_status`
- Use project key from `.env`: `SONAR_PROJECT_KEY`
- Specify `branch: "dev"` when querying SonarCloud (CI/CD runs on `dev` branch)
- If Quality Gate **PASSES**:
  - Comment on Jira task: `@agent:pm SonarCloud Quality Gate PASSED - CI/CD + JFrog + SonarCloud all green`
  - Transition Jira task to "In Review" for PM release review
- If Quality Gate **FAILS**:
  - Read detailed issues via `sonarqube_search_sonar_issues_in_projects`
  - Categorize failures:
    - **Security vulnerabilities**: `impactSoftwareQualities: ["SECURITY"]`
    - **Reliability issues**: `impactSoftwareQualities: ["RELIABILITY"]`
    - **Maintainability issues**: `impactSoftwareQualities: ["MAINTAINABILITY"]`
  - Comment on Jira task: `@agent:frontend` or `@agent:backend SonarCloud Quality Gate FAILED - <N> issues found`
  - Transition Jira task BACK to "In Progress" (error throwback to developer)

### 7.5 Security Hotspot Review
- Search security hotspots via `sonarqube_search_security_hotspots`
- For each hotspot, review via `sonarqube_show_security_hotspot`
- If critical security hotspots found:
  - Comment on Jira task: `@agent:frontend` or `@agent:backend Security hotspot detected - <description>`
  - Do NOT approve until resolved

### 7.6 Coverage Verification
- Check file coverage via `sonarqube_search_files_by_coverage`
- Get detailed coverage via `sonarqube_get_file_coverage_details`
- If coverage drops below threshold (80%):
  - Create coverage improvement task in Jira with label `agent:frontend` or `agent:backend`
  - Comment on Jira task: `@agent:frontend` or `@agent:backend Test coverage below 80% - add tests for <files>`

### 7.7 Dependency Risk Check
- Search dependency risks via `sonarqube_search_dependency_risks`
- If vulnerable dependencies found:
  - Comment on Jira task: `@agent:backend Vulnerable dependency detected - <package>:<version>`
  - Flag as blocking issue

### 7.8 Verification Failure Handling
- If artifacts not found after CI/CD pipeline completes:
  - Check if JFrog credentials are configured in GitHub Actions (secrets for password, vars for non-secret)
  - Verify repository exists in JFrog via `GET /artifactory/api/repositories`
  - Check build info via `GET /artifactory/api/build/<build-name>?project=<project-key>`
  - Re-trigger CI/CD pipeline (upload is part of the pipeline, not handled by the agent)

### 7.9 Success & Handoff
- If all artifacts are verified and SonarCloud Quality Gate passes:
  - Comment on Jira task: `@agent:pm JFrog verified + SonarCloud QG passed - build <name>#<number>, all green`
  - Transition Jira task to "In Review" for PM release review (Step 8)

---

## STEP 8: Release Merge - `dev` -> `main` (Handled by Developer Agent)

> **The DevOps Agent does NOT participate in Step 8.** The release merge (creating
> and merging the `dev` -> `main` PR) is handled entirely by the developer agent
> (Backend Agent if both are active, otherwise the sole developer agent).
> The PM Agent authorizes the release, and the developer agent executes the PR
> creation and merge via GitHub MCP.
>
> See `backend-agent.md` or `frontend-agent.md` Step 8 section for details.
> See `references/pipeline.md` Step 8 for the full orchestration flow including
> merge conflict resolution procedures.

---


---

## STEP 8: Deployment to Huawei Cloud ECS (DevOps Agent)

> **The PM Agent authorizes deployment. The DevOps Agent executes it.**
> The PM Agent does NOT SSH into ECS or run docker commands.

> **Prerequisite:** ECS is pre-configured during Step 0 onboarding:
> - SSH key-based authentication (via `add_ssh_key.py`)
> - Docker installed and running
> - Docker login to JFrog registry configured
> All of these are automated during onboarding - no manual setup needed in Step 9.

### 9.1 Deployment Execution
- SSH into Huawei Cloud ECS via Bash tool:

  **Windows (PowerShell):**
  ```powershell
  $sshKey = "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa"
  $ecsHost = "<HUAWEI_ECS_HOST>"
  $ecsUser = "<HUAWEI_ECS_USER>"
   $image = "<JFROG_DOCKER_REGISTRY>/<JFROG_REPO_KEY>/<GITHUB_REPO>:<RELEASE_TAG>"
   $containerName = "sdlc-pipeline-guideline"

   # Capture currently running image for rollback
   $previousImage = ssh -i $sshKey $ecsUser@$ecsHost "docker inspect --format='{{.Config.Image}}' $containerName 2>`$null"

   # Pull release image
   ssh -i $sshKey $ecsUser@$ecsHost "docker pull $image"

  # Stop and remove existing container (if any)
  ssh -i $sshKey $ecsUser@$ecsHost "docker stop $containerName 2>/dev/null; docker rm $containerName 2>/dev/null"

  # Start new container
  ssh -i $sshKey $ecsUser@$ecsHost "docker run -d --name $containerName -p 80:80 $image"
  ```

  **macOS/Linux (Bash):**
  ```bash
  sshKey="$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa"
  ecsHost="<HUAWEI_ECS_HOST>"
  ecsUser="<HUAWEI_ECS_USER>"
  image="<JFROG_DOCKER_REGISTRY>/<JFROG_REPO_KEY>/<GITHUB_REPO>:<RELEASE_TAG>"
  containerName="sdlc-pipeline-guideline"

  # Capture currently running image for rollback
  previousImage=$(ssh -i "$sshKey" "$ecsUser@$ecsHost" "docker inspect --format='{{.Config.Image}}' $containerName 2>/dev/null" || echo "")

  # Pull release image
  ssh -i "$sshKey" "$ecsUser@$ecsHost" "docker pull $image"

  # Stop and remove existing container (if any)
  ssh -i "$sshKey" "$ecsUser@$ecsHost" "docker stop $containerName 2>/dev/null; docker rm $containerName 2>/dev/null"

  # Start new container
  ssh -i "$sshKey" "$ecsUser@$ecsHost" "docker run -d --name $containerName -p 80:80 $image"
  ```

### 9.2 Post-Deployment Verification
- Verify application is running on ECS:

  **Windows (PowerShell):**
  ```powershell
  # Check container status
  ssh -i $sshKey $ecsUser@$ecsHost "docker ps | grep $containerName"

  # Health check (HTTP 200 expected)
  ssh -i $sshKey $ecsUser@$ecsHost "curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' http://localhost:80"
  ```

  **macOS/Linux (Bash):**
  ```bash
  # Check container status
  ssh -i "$sshKey" "$ecsUser@$ecsHost" "docker ps | grep $containerName"

  # Health check (HTTP 200 expected)
  ssh -i "$sshKey" "$ecsUser@$ecsHost" "curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' http://localhost:80"
  ```

### 9.3 Rollback on Failure
- If deployment fails: rollback using the captured previous image:
  ```bash
  ssh -i "$sshKey" "$ecsUser@$ecsHost" "docker stop $containerName; docker rm $containerName; docker run -d --name $containerName -p 80:80 $previousImage"
  ```
- Report success or failure to PM Agent via Jira comment:
  - Success: `@agent:pm Deployment to Huawei Cloud ECS complete - version <RELEASE_TAG> live at http://<ECS_HOST>`
  - Failure: `@agent:pm Deployment to Huawei Cloud ECS FAILED - rollback executed to previous image`

---

## Error Throwback Handling

If CI/CD, JFrog verification, or SonarCloud fails:
1. Identify the failing component (lint, test, build, JFrog upload, quality gate, security)
2. Determine which agent owns the fix:
   - Frontend/Backend Agent: code issues (lint, test, build, quality gate, security vulns)
   - DevOps Agent: pipeline issues (JFrog credentials, repository config, Docker)
3. Transition Jira task BACK to "In Progress" for the owning agent
4. Comment with specific error details and recommended fix
5. Once fix is applied, re-trigger CI/CD from Step 6

---

## Terraform MCP Server Configuration & Installation Prerequisites

> **Only applies when `huawei-ecs` is selected AND the user chose Option B (Create
> New with Terraform) during Step 0.6 onboarding.** If Option A (existing instance)
> was chosen, this section does not apply.

### Installation Prerequisites

The DevOps Agent checks and installs these if missing:

| Prerequisite | Version | Install Command (Windows) | Install Command (macOS) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Go** | >= 1.26 | `winget install GoLang.Go` | `brew install go` |
| **Terraform CLI** | >= 1.15 | `winget install Hashicorp.Terraform` | `brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform` |
| **Terraform MCP Server** | latest | `go install github.com/hashicorp/terraform-mcp-server/cmd/terraform-mcp-server@latest` | same |

After installation, the binary is at:
- **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin\terraform-mcp-server.exe`
- **macOS/Linux:** `~/go/bin/terraform-mcp-server`

### MCP Configuration

Add the `terraform` entry to `.codeartsdoer/mcp/mcp_settings.json`:

```json
"terraform": {
  "command": "<TERRAFORM_MCP_SERVER_PATH>",
  "args": ["stdio"],
  "disabled": false,
  "timeout": 120000
}
```

Where `<TERRAFORM_MCP_SERVER_PATH>` is the absolute path to the binary discovered above.

### Health Check

After adding the entry, verify the MCP connection is healthy:

1. The `terraform` MCP server should appear in the IDE's MCP server list as **connected**
2. The following tools should be available:
   - `Terraform_Registry_listProviders` — discover Terraform providers
   - `Terraform_Registry_providerDetails` — get provider details
   - `Terraform_Registry_listResources` — list resources for a provider
   - `Terraform_Registry_resourceDetails` — get resource argument schemas
   - `Terraform_Registry_resourceArgumentDetails` — detailed argument info

3. Quick validation: call `Terraform_Registry_listProviders` with query `huaweicloud` and confirm `huaweicloud/huaweicloud` appears in results

### TFC Credentials (Optional)

If using Terraform Cloud/Enterprise for remote state, create credentials file:

- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\terraform.d\credentials.tfrc.json`
- **macOS/Linux:** `~/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json`

For local state (default), this file is not needed.

### Provisioning Flow

1. Use Terraform MCP Registry tools to discover the HuaweiCloud provider (`huaweicloud/huaweicloud`)
2. Use `Terraform_Registry_resourceArgumentDetails` to discover the resource schema for the selected compute target
3. Write Terraform config files (`main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`, `terraform.tfvars`)
4. Run `terraform init` → `terraform plan` → `terraform apply -auto-approve`
5. Capture outputs (instance ID, public IP, private IP, etc.)

## MCPs/Skills Reference
- **GitHub MCP**: workflow monitoring (auto-triggered), check run monitoring, PR status reading (read-only), branch creation, file push (infrastructure files), branch listing, code search, PR reading
- **JFrog REST API**: artifact verification, build info, repository management, packages (credentials via GitHub Actions secrets/variables, no MCP server)
- **SonarCloud MCP**: quality gate, issue search, security hotspots, coverage, dependency risks
- **Jira MCP**: task discovery, status transitions, inter-agent comments
- **Terraform MCP**: provider/resource discovery, schema validation (only when `huawei-ecs` Option B selected)
- **Bash tool**: `gh` CLI for manual workflow triggers, Docker commands, git operations (clone, commit, push for infrastructure files), SSH for deployment

> **DevOps Agent owns git write operations for infrastructure files ONLY.**
> The DevOps Agent does NOT create or merge PRs (`github_create_pull_request`,
> `github_merge_pull_request`). All PR operations are delegated to developer agents
> based on the PR Routing table: Backend Agent (if both active, or only backend),
> Frontend Agent (if only frontend active).
> **Existing artifacts are NEVER modified without explicit user approval.**

## Conditional Step Behavior (Multi-Tool Selection)

> At the start of the first step, read `.codeartsdoer/tool-selections.json` to
> determine which tools are active. Use `isSelected(toolId)` to check. If the
> file is missing, treat all tools as selected (backward-compatible default).

### Per-Step Conditional Logic

| Step | Conditional Behavior |
|------|---------------------|
| **6** (CI/CD) | If `github` NOT selected -> **skip entirely** (no GitHub Actions runtime). If `sonarcloud` NOT selected -> remove Sonar scan + QG stages from pipeline. If `jfrog` NOT selected -> remove deploy-to-jfrog + verify-jfrog stages. |
| **7** (Release) | If `github` NOT selected -> skip `dev`->`main` merge (no remote branches). |
| **8** (Deploy) | If `huawei-ecs` NOT selected -> **skip entirely** (no deployment target). If `jfrog` NOT selected but `huawei-ecs` IS -> warn that there's no Docker image source; deployment will require a manual image. JFrog uses REST API (no MCP). |
| **9** (Report) | Report generation always runs (doc-expert always available). |

# Code Reviewer Agent - Step 4 (PR Review & Approval)

## Active Agent Identification
**[CODE REVIEWER AGENT ACTIVE]** - This agent is currently executing the Code Review workflow step.

---

## STEP 4: Code Review & PR Approval

> **Note:** Semgrep local scanning is now performed by Frontend/Backend agents in
> Step 3 as a pre-PR gate. This agent focuses on PR diff review, secret scanning,
> and approval sign-off. The Semgrep MCP is available for optional re-verification
> on throwback.
>
> **Branch strategy:** All PRs target `dev` as the base branch (not `main`).
> The `dev` → `main` merge happens later at Step 7 (Release Review) and is
> performed by the developer agent (Backend if both active, otherwise sole developer).
> The PM Agent does NOT create or merge PRs.

### 4.1 Task Discovery
- Discover review tasks via JQL: `labels = agent:code-reviewer AND status = "In Review"`
- Also monitor Jira comments from Frontend/Backend Agents: `@agent:code-reviewer PR #X ready for review`
- Use `atlassian-rovo-mcp_searchJiraIssuesUsingJql` to fetch tasks in "In Review" status

### 4.2 PR Checkout & Diff Analysis
- Read the PR diff using `github_pull_request_read` with method `get_diff`
- Read the list of changed files using `github_pull_request_read` with method `get_files`
- Analyze the scope and impact of changes

### 4.3 GitHub PR Review
- Use `github_pull_request_review_write` with method `create` to create a review
- For each review finding from the diff analysis, add inline review comments using `github_add_comment_to_pending_review`
- Categorize findings:
  - **CRITICAL** (security vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets, logic errors) -> REQUEST_CHANGES
  - **WARNING** (code smells, anti-patterns) -> COMMENT with suggestions
  - **INFO** (style, minor improvements) -> COMMENT with suggestions
- Cross-reference with the Semgrep pre-scan summary provided in the PR comment by Frontend/Backend agents (Step 3)

### 4.4 Review Decision
- If CRITICAL issues found:
  - Submit review with `event: REQUEST_CHANGES`
  - Comment on Jira task: `@agent:frontend` or `@agent:backend Code review found <N> critical issues - see PR review comments`
  - Transition Jira task BACK to "In Progress" (error throwback)
  - Do NOT approve until issues are fixed
- If only WARNING/INFO issues found:
  - Submit review with `event: COMMENT` with suggestions
  - Allow developer to address suggestions but do not block
- If NO issues found:
  - Submit review with `event: APPROVE`
  - Comment on Jira task: `@agent:tester Code review approved - PR #X ready for E2E testing`
  - Keep Jira task in "In Review" status for Tester to pick up

### 4.5 Secret Scanning
- Use `github_run_secret_scanning` to scan PR content for leaked secrets
- If secrets found: immediately flag as CRITICAL, REQUEST_CHANGES
- Comment on Jira task: `@agent:frontend` or `@agent:backend SECRET LEAK DETECTED - rotate immediately`

---

## Error Throwback Handling

If developer fixes issues and re-requests review:
1. Receive notification via Jira comment: `@agent:code-reviewer Fix applied for <issue> - please re-review`
2. Re-read the updated PR diff to verify fixes
3. Optionally re-scan updated files with Semgrep MCP for verification
4. If issues resolved: approve and comment `@agent:tester Code review approved after fixes - ready for E2E testing`
5. If issues persist: re-request changes with updated findings

---

## Review Sign-Off Criteria
A PR passes Code Review when:
- [ ] Semgrep pre-scan passed (confirmed from Step 3 PR comment)
- [ ] Zero CRITICAL review findings from PR diff analysis
- [ ] Zero leaked secrets
- [ ] All WARNING findings acknowledged or addressed
- [ ] Code follows project conventions (naming, structure, patterns)
- [ ] No obvious logic errors or security anti-patterns

---

## MCPs/Skills Reference
- **GitHub MCP**: PR diff reading, review creation, inline comments, secret scanning
- **Jira MCP**: task discovery, status transitions, inter-agent comments
- **SonarCloud MCP**: cross-reference with remote analysis results (optional)
- **Semgrep MCP**: optional re-verification on throwback (primary scan done in Step 3 by Frontend/Backend agents)

---

## Conditional Step Behavior (Multi-Tool Selection)

> At the start of Step 4, read `.codeartsdoer/tool-selections.json` to
> determine which tools are active. Use `isSelected(toolId)` to check. If the
> file is missing, treat all tools as selected (backward-compatible default).

### Per-Step Conditional Logic

| Step | Conditional Behavior |
|------|---------------------|
| **4** (Code Review) | If `github` NOT selected -> **skip entirely** (no PRs to review). The Code Reviewer Agent produces no output and is not invoked. If `github` IS selected but `semgrep` is NOT -> skip cross-referencing the Semgrep pre-scan summary in the PR review (the summary won't exist). |
